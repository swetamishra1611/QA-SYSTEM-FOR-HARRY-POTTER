        "question": "Why don't Muggle-born wizards use Muggle technology to fight Death Eaters?",
        "question_body": "We know that wizards in the Harry Potter universe are subject to regular physical harm (e.g. witness injuries from being hit by Bludgers or just colliding with things when playing Quidditch). Therefore, it's almost a certainty that an average wizard would be vulnerable to, say, a bunch of bullets . There may likely be spell(s) to protect from projectiles - witness Dumbledore's shield deployed when Voldemort sent a bunch of glass at him during the Duel in the Ministry Atrium at the end of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (according to Wikia , possibly an unusually powerful Protego or the Silver shield). But: those spells obviously take effort/energy/time to cast (not everyone's Dumbledore) AND more likely than not most Death Eaters wouldn't recognize a Muggle gun for a threat (or realize what kind of threat) till too late. So, the guns should at best allow an over-matched OotP member (e.g. Harry or Hermione) to greatly equalize the power between any regular Death Eaters and themselves, and even perhaps help against Voldemort (who can't be killed with a bullet, but, at best, would need to expend magical energy and time into conjuring a shield, and, at worst, be stopped/interrupted/driven off). So I'm looking for an explanation - ideally in-universe, but possibly just some statement by JKR - of why the Muggle-born OotP - who are likely very much at ease AND familiar with Muggle technology and live in the late 20th century - do not use guns. Or, for that matter, ANY Muggle technology of the late 20th century ? Cue Arthur C. Clarke's \"indistinguishable from magic\" meme. Even if they are on some kind of idiotic moral crusade to never kill their opponents (even the Jedi aren't this dumb), given the time-frame, non-lethal weapons would have already existed, such as rubber bullets and tasers. NOTE: Please don't offer the \"if they do it, Death Eaters would start using guns as well\" theory. First, Death Eaters would have used the guns if they knew how to, anyway. Second, the guns, like any \"secret weapon\", could be reserved for strategic battles, say the defense of Hogwarts in Deathly Hallows . The origin of the question stems from two things. First, Harry's fascination with all things that are different in the magical world (e.g. moving photographs), based on his knowledge of the Muggle material world, as well as the somewhat amusing cluelessness of the \"Muggle artifacts\" expert, Mr. Weasley, regarding Muggle items and how they work. Basically, from the books, it's clear that the Wizarding world wouldn't know details about guns or what they are for or how they work. The second thing is it's clear, at least initially, that wizards are afraid of Muggles finding out about them. Hence all the efforts to cloak their society (basically, do you REALLY want every Muggle gunning for you, even with Magic)? The idea of how control over the Muggle world seems to be more indirect, by Death Eaters asserting mind-control over the government. This means there's an implicit understanding by Death Eaters that they don't stand a chance against armed Muggles even given the magical disparity. Considering Harry and Hermione's overall adaptability and inventiveness (and brains in the latter case), it's mind-boggling that the idea of fighting Death Eaters with modern technology completely slipped their mind. I mean, it's a basic part of human myth (see Steel vs. Magic themes in Conan books, or Beowulf , or heck, A Yankee in King Arthur's Court ). So it's not like the idea of using technology against magic would be impossible to come up with. The question begs itself - why not? Considering the fact that Rowling generally tried to be logical and consistent in building the HP universe, I feel like there must be some in-universe explanation for this that I just didn't notice . (in-universe answers only unless there are some authoritative out-of-universe statements that are part of canon).",
        "answer": "I believe, though I've been unable to find a reference, that JK Rowling actually mentioned this at one point. Part of the reason that the wizards hide is the fact that, if the Muggles so desired, the entire wizarding community could be wiped out by Muggle tech almost trivially. Shields, teleportation, telekinesis, etc would fare poorly against an enemy who doesn't have to have line of sight, or make fancy motions, or incant faux-latin phrases. If a special forces team had assaulted Hogwarts, instead of a group of Death Eaters, the castle would have been rubble and most of the population dead. (The special forces team would have suffered hideous casualties, of course, but only on egress) The wizards, at least those who make decisions and laws, know this. Everything about Hogwarts seems to be designed to separate wizards from Muggles, and muggle-borns from their roots. I wouldn't be surprised if there was an area-affecting spell around the castle that encouraged the students away from thinking about Muggle solutions (similar to the ones that make Muggles avoid areas). If one wizard had used an M60 to wipe out a group of Death Eaters, or even Big V himself (after he was rendered mortal, at least) wizards could not have failed to acknowledge this generally. It would create a panic. Suddenly, the Muggles, who most wizards seem to regard as half-blind, plodding simpletons, turn into a threat. The mightiest wizards couldn't stand up to Big V, but a single piece of Muggle-tech could trivially kill him? And there's BILLIONS of Muggles...it would terrify the wizarding population in a way Voldemort never could. The combination of damaging Muggle-tech with the wizarding world could only destroy the entire wizarding world, and their leadership knows it (or knew it at one point, and created laws such that the separation would continue).",

        "question": "How did Dumbledore, or anyone, know Lily had sacrificed herself for Harry?",
        "question_body": "There were no witnesses, except for Harry, who was still a baby and didn't relive / remember the experience until much later. James and Lily were both dead, Voldemort was not quite dead but not much better and not likely to tell anyone what happened. So how did Dumbledore, or anyone , know that Lily sacrificed herself for Harry? Keep in mind that even finding out what happened in a more general sense, that James and Lily had died and Voldemort had been killed by a rebounding killing curse, was difficult enough . Of course, it would be clear they had died defending their family, themselves and Harry, but nothing found at the scene would have told anyone that Lily had been given the choice to live, but did not take it. Perhaps James had been given the same choice, but declined as well. Or — less likely — perhaps he was the only one given the choice, while Lily was killed right away. Yet Dumbledore seems to have known, as shown in this quote (emphasis mine): But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated — to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother’s blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative. She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother’s sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you. Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 37. Thanks to Anthony Grist for pointing out. Here, Dumbledore talks about Lily's sacrifice , specifically her sacrifice, not just dying defending him, like what happened to James. Since Harry is delivered to the Dursleys within 24 hours, Dumbledore must have found out within that time span. And he must have known with enough confidence to base the entire protection of Harry upon that fact. Of course, he must have known about this kind of magic, as the quote shows. But how did he know it was applicable to Lily and Harry? This question has been asked on Quora , however, I can't read beyond the first answer there and even if I signed up to read all answers, from what I've heard, Quora doesn't seem to be the most reliable source. Slytherincess pointed me to a related question of hers , in which she asks how Voldemort knew about this type of magic (JKR's books and interviews seem to contradict each other there). But what I want to know is how it was found out what happened, with such detail that Dumbledore knew Lily had sacrificed herself.",
        "answer": "I think the answer is likely a combination of everybody's favourite Potions master, Severus Snape, and some solid guesswork on Dumbledore's part. Dumbledore knew even before their deaths that Snape had asked Voldemort to spare Lily's life: “If she means so much to you,” said Dumbledore, “surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?” “I have — I have asked him —” ... The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore’s office, and something was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop. “I thought … you were going … to keep her … safe. …” “She and James put their faith in the wrong person,” said Dumbledore. “Rather like you, Severus. Weren’t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?” Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 33 - The Prince's Tale Clearly they believed, for whatever reason, that Voldemort would keep his word. From there it's not a big leap to conclude that, since she had also been killed, she'd refused his offer to save herself. As SQB stated in the comments, this all hinges on Dumbledore and Snape's belief that Voldemort would keep his word. Why would they do so? At its simplest, Voldemort has absolutely no reason not to keep his word. Snape had helped him tremendously by informing him of (part of) the prophecy, and - as Voldemort said to Wormtail after his resurrection in Goblet of Fire - Voldemort rewards his helpers. Harry was the only thing he viewed as a threat, the last thing standing between him and true immortality, so keeping Lily alive doesn't impact him at all. By keeping her alive he would secure Snape's allegiance by giving him the one thing he desires above all else. He may even have hoped that, given enough time, Lily could be persuaded to join him. He seems sufficiently lacking in understanding of human emotions to have considered that possibility; obviously she's never actually going to love the man who gave up her husband and son to be murdered, or join with the one who murdered them.",

Huh? How can this be? The out-of-canon answers are more than adequate: JKR simply didn't want to write That Kind of Story (and I'm not convinced she could have if she tried). The author's choice is final. Adding sex to the mix would have complicated the story horribly. Adding sex to the mix would have cast the moral incoherence of the wizard world into unbearably sharp relief. JKR's core readership (preadolescents) wouldn't have stood for it. The cries of \"Eeeeew!\" would have been deafening. And the sales would have reflected that. As far as I know, JKR dealt with the whole thing by simply and comprehensively ignoring it, so there's not likely any explanation within the books (although I could be wrong). Is there a mention of a \"Sal Petrus\" spell worked into the wardings of Hogwarts? So. Has the subject come up? Has anyone had the chutzpah to ask JKR?",

        "question": "Why didn't the basilisk bite in Chamber of Secrets destroy the Horcrux?",
        "question_body": "As the title asks, why didn't the basilisk bite received in the Chamber of Secrets destroy the Horcrux inside the bitten person? Yes, I know Fawkes quite quickly healed the bite wound with his phoenix tears, but when Harry used the basilisk fang to destroy Tom Riddle's diary the destruction of that Horcrux was immediate. When Ron hit the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor, it was destroyed immediately. Although the destruction of the ring occurred off-page, Dumbledore used the Sword of Gryffindor to destroy it, so presumably, like the locket, it was gone right away. Nagini died straightaway when Neville decapitated her. The destruction of the Hufflepuff cup happens off-page. The diadem seems to have been destroyed by Fiendfyre immediately as well, as when Harry examined it outside the Room of Requirement it was already leaking a blood-like substance, and then it cracked in half. When Voldemort hit Harry with Avada Kedavra in the forest, Harry woke up in limbo with the last fragment of Voldemort's soul - that awful flayed baby-like being - separated from him immediately. Is there a logical/canon-based explanation for why the fragment of Voldemort's soul residing in Harry wasn't destroyed upon Harry being bitten by the basilisk? NOTE: I've read the HP Wiki's entry on Horcruxes; however, I find the HP Wiki to be inconsistent in its accuracy, so I'm hesitant to accept the Wiki's explanation on the matter. I'd prefer an explanation constructed from information in the books or a statement by JKR, or the like.",
        "answer": "01.21.12 I have found the answer to this question from J.K. Rowling herself: Q: When Harry was stabbed by a basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, since he was a Horcrux, shouldn't it have been destroyed then? JKR: I have been asked that a lot. Harry was exceptionally fortunate in that he had Fawkes. So before he could be destroyed without repair, which is what is necessary to destroy a horcrux, he was mended. However, I made sure that Fawkes wasn't around the second time a Horcrux got stabbed by a basilisk fang, so the poison did its work and it was irreparable within a short period of time.... I established early in the book, Hermione says that you destroy a Horcrux by using something so powerful that there's no remedy. But she does say there is a remedy for basilisk poison but of course it has to be administered immediately and when they stab the cup later - boy I'm really blowing this for anyone who hasn't finished the book - there's Fawkes, is my answer . And thank you for giving me a chance to say that because people have argued that quite a lot. JK Rowling at Carnegie Hall 10.20.07 There you have it!",

        "question": "Given a magical world, why is the Quibbler ridiculous?",
        "question_body": "Harry Potter is a high-magic setting and magic is everywhere. There are very few limits on what spellcasting can accomplish, given you know the right spell. (Some of those limits are Gamp's Elemental Laws of Transfiguration or the fact that you cannot return someone from the dead, but we don't get a lot of them. Felix Felicis, the Philosopher's Stone and Time-Turners give their users terrifying power over causality, mortality and time itself, respectively.) New spells and potions are invented all the time. Magical beings range from boring Flubberworms to square-cube-law-shattering dragons, on which there don't seem to be firm limits for what is \"plausible\" or not. Yet when we are introduced to Luna Lovegood at the beginning of OotP, Hermione pooh-poohs the Quibbler as a conspiracy rag. It claims the Crumple-Horned Snorkack is real! It claims Cornelius Fudge has a battalion of Heliopaths and is pursuing a secret campaign of goblin genocide! How absurd. Still disparaging the ridiculous idea of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack, Hermione climbs into a carriage pulled by carnivorous skeletal pegasi invisible to those who haven't seen death, and makes her way to the castle. What heuristic could Hermione (and the wizarding world at large) possibly use to evaluate the Quibbler as ridiculous or not? In a world where criminals (and enemies of the government) are sent to an island prison guarded by floating spirits of despair, why is the idea of a secret government battalion of fire spirits so silly? In a world where prejudice against \"subhumans\" is depressingly widespread (as Hermione well knows) and relations with goblins remain strained since the bloody Goblin Uprising of 17-whatever, why is secret goblin murder so absurd? Especially when Hermione knows Fudge to be pursuing a disinformation campaign against Dumbledore and Harry, and generally trusts the Ministry as far as she can throw it? In our world we develop heuristics, based on our own experience and what we are told, to sort things into \"believable\" and \"not believable.\" I know the square-cube law makes big animals cumbersome, and the biggest flying animal I've ever seen is a condor, so if you told me you saw elephants flying the other day I would be disinclined to believe you. Conversely, I've ridden in airplanes before and have a rough idea of how they work, so the idea of a supersonic plane like the Concorde doesn't weird me out. The thing is, I don't see why someone growing up in the wizarding world would draw the line at anything. Students at Hogwarts are exposed to new and wondrous spells, potions and creatures all the time, and the apparent limits of possibility are pushed further with every passing school year. So what gives?",
        "answer": "Magic, in the wizarding world, is certainly powerful. To us, coming from the outside, it might seem like it can do anything. But it can't, due to various rules and stipulations we only know in part. To us, they may seem arbitrary - reversing time, yes, but reversing death, no? - but the differences are probably clearer on the inside. Consider our own technological society, and a newcomer to it, perhaps from the 18th century. We have airplanes that can cross continents in hours and rockets that reach the moons and instant video chats. But suggest to a native of the 21st century that you can teleport, or change your body's shape, and you'll be scoffed at like a crackpot? For our erstwhile time traveler, moon rockets being possible but teleports impossible must seem just as arbitrary, just like our confusion at why Ron and Hermione seem to arbitrarily dismiss some magical possibilities. And it isn't just a question of magical/technological capabilities. Conspiracies are the same in both cases - Cornelius Fudge using Heliopaths to kill goblins is no different than the government keeping aliens in Area 51. It's not impossible , it's just ridiculously improbable.",

        "question": "Why would Snape set his office password to 'Dumbledore'?",
        "question_body": "It seems to me that Snape's choice of password for his study when he was Headmaster was kinda weird. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape's last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the Headmaster's office. \"Password?\" \" Dumbledore! \" said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral staircase behind. (Deathly Hallows, Chapter 33, The Prince's Tale). As I say, this is a bizarre choice of password. To confirm, at this stage Snape's cover was very much intact. To the Death Eaters and the Order alike, he was believed to be a committed Voldemort-supporter. Which makes the figurehead of the anti-Voldemort movement a rather odd choice for your office password. It seems reasonable to suppose that Snape would have hosted meetings with fellow Death Eaters (such as the Callows) in his office during his tenure. Indeed, he probably had Voldemort himself up there at one point. And now everything was cool and dark: the sun was barely visible over the horizon as he glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds towards the lake. \"I shall join you in the castle shortly,\" he said in his high, cold voice. \"Leave me now.\" (Deathly Hallows, Chapter 24, The Wandmaker). Wouldn't that have been a slightly awkward moment, with Snape having to explain his choice of password to his supposed master? \"Hmm, why did you choose Dumbledore - the man whose grave I've just ransacked - as your password, Snape?\" \"Errr...no reason\". Wouldn't Snape's choice of password have seemed odd to friends and foes alike? Didn't it risk blowing his cover in some way? If so, why did Snape choose it?",
        "answer": "I don't think he chose \"Dumbledore\" as his password. He was an accomplished double agent, and would have chosen a suitable password that would avoid arousing suspicion from either side. There are a few potential explanations: It wasn't the password at all We know from Order of the Phoenix that the gargoyle controlling access to the Headmaster's office has some level of awareness, since it refused entry to Umbridge when she was acting as Headmistress: \"... The Fat Friar told me -\" he dropped his voice conspiratorially, so that Harry, Ron and Hermione had to lean closer to him to hear \"- that Umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after they'd searched the castle and grounds for him. Couldn't get past the gargoyle. The Head's office has sealed itself against her.\" Ernie smirked. \"Apparently she had a right little tantrum.\" Order of the Phoenix - Chapter 28, Snape's Worst Memory With that established, I think it's considerably more likely that the gargoyle, knowing who Harry was and hearing him call for Dumbledore, simply decided to grant him access to the Head's office. It was no longer Snape's office Snape was no longer Headmaster of Hogwarts at that point. There isn't, as far as I know, any mention of a deputy Headmaster or Headmistress during the events of Deathly Hallows. If the position was vacant, it's possible that the interim Head position would be filled by the previous deputy Headmistress, Minerva McGonagall. In that case, the gargoyle may determine a suitable - though temporary password - until she's able to specify one of her own choosing. In that situation \"Dumbledore\" is as good a choice as any (and far better than most). It was a password specific for Harry Due to the gargoyle's at least limited awareness, it's possible that the Headmaster can set a general use password, but also instruct it to open in certain situations or in response to a different password given only by specific people. It's possible that \"Dumbledore\" only worked because Harry was the one saying it, and that it wouldn't have been accepted as the password if anybody else had said it. This would, however, require at least some amount of forethought and planning on Snape's part and quite a lot of luck on Harry's (though he's spent the last six years proving he has an uncommon amount of that) for him to get the password without being told it by Snape.",

        "question": "How much older was Hermione after her third year at Hogwarts?",
        "question_body": "In her third year at Hogwarts, Hermione is given a time-turner so she can take more classes. Several of her classes are concurrent to each other, so she attends one class (for 1-2 hours) goes back in time, and attends a different class during the same time frame. But from an aging point of view, she should age 4 hours in relation to the 2 hours everyone else ages. How much older should Hermione be relative to everyone else after using the time-turner for an entire school year?",
        "answer": "For those of you who aren't going to make it to the end of this post, it comes out to a week (plus half a day). It is not certain whether wizards using time turners \"age\" faster, but for the sake of the question let's assume so and see if we can quantify somewhat. According to the Harry Potter Wiki , there are 12 classes she could have been taking (7 core, 5 elective), and she signed up for all of them (Chamber of Secrets, first American edition, p.252). Assume she was allowed to take all of them (reasonable, I think). After dropping two classes (Divination and Muggle Studies), Hermione was able to resume a normal schedule. We'll take that as showing that ten courses fills the time allotted for classes completely. Let's say that's six hours a day, five days a week. That would make three hours per class per week; the two extra classes would then add six hours a week to Hermione's age. We'll assume she didn't use the TT for extra studying time on top of that (though I'm not quite certain of that). The students arrived at school on September 1st as always, and Hermione dropped Divination around Easter. I didn't quickly find the event in the book, so we'll assume it was Easter (April 3, 1994). Now, if I counted right on my calendar, that's 29 weeks for Divination. The Christmas holidays remove two weeks from that, and we'll say another week for reading and exam period, so we'll say 26 weeks for three hours a week, making the added time from Divination three days and six hours. She continued Muggle Studies through the end of the year. The wiki page says that's in the third week of June, for a total of 40 weeks (again assuming I counted correctly). Take out the three weeks off before Easter, and another two for reading, exams, and results, for a total of 35 weeks doubling for Muggle Studies another three hours a week. This comes out to four days and three hours. Adding this to the Divination time and the three hours she and Harry spent saving Sirius and Buckbeak, we get seven days, twelve hours . Therefore, the answer appears to be just over a week.",

If Tom Riddle had succeeded in sucking all the life energy out of Ginny and had come back alive, wouldn't that have meant there were two Voldemorts in the world? The wraith one which had lived in Quirrell, and the newly constituted one? This Tom Riddle clearly doesn't have the memories of the wraith version. As a bonus: If they both existed, would they have competed against each other?",
        "answer": "I go back and forth on whether the purpose of the diary Horcrux was to reincarnate Tom Riddle (and note the difference between reincarnate -- to give another body to; to incarnate anew -- and to protect a person, Voldemort, from death). The purpose of a Horcrux is not to create a new individual, but to protect its creator from death. That said, the diary Horcrux is the only of Voldemort's Horcruxes to serve two purposes: \"What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard,\" [Dumbledore] \"I still don't understand,\" said Harry. \"Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work -- in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin's monster would be unleashed again.\" \"Well, he didn't want his hard work to be wasted,\" said Harry. \"He wanted people to know he was Slytherin's heir, because he couldn't take credit at the time.\" ( Half-Blood Prince -- Chapter 23 ) However, canon is a little inconsistent. In Chamber of Secrets , Tom Riddle clearly becomes corporeal in some form, feeding off a \"strong diet of [Ginny's] deepest fears and darkest secrets.\" He grew powerful enough to feed a bit of his soul back into Ginny. Tom Riddle says about Ginny, \"She put too much into the diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last . . . \" ( Chamber of Secrets -- Chapter 17). While Half-Blood Prince references the diary as a weapon to possess someone else to work on Tom Riddle's behalf, Chamber of Secrets shows that he was able to return to some kind of form. Tom Riddle is aware that he is also Voldemort and seems to possess Voldemort's future knowledge and memories: I AM LORD VOLDEMORT and \"Twice -- in your past, in my future -- we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you survive?\" ( Chamber of Secrets -- Chapter 17) Specifically, if Tom Riddle had indeed been reincarnated, he would have taken the form of Tom Riddle, who at sixteen years old was not yet Lord Voldemort, although he had decided on the moniker for himself while still a student at Hogwarts. Therefore, Tom Riddle would have co-existed with Voldemort as separate entities of the same life force; it would not be Voldemort clones running around. Would Tom Riddle and Voldemort have competed against one another? Not in the sense of, \"Hey, let's grab a pick-up game of Quidditch!\" Dumbledore says: \"Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir [of Life] intolerable [ . . . ] Therefore, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see . . . or as close to immortal as any man can be.\" ( Half-Blood Prince -- Chapter 23) I think Tom Riddle would not be a match for Voldemort; at sixteen, Tom Riddle simply had not developed his magical abilities to Voldemort's level. My guess is that the magically superior Voldemort would have used and exploited the reincarnated Tom Riddle for every possible purpose (whatever purposes those might have been) and then killed him. I postulate that the reincarnated Tom Riddle, born of the diary Horcrux, would not himself have been a Horcrux, just as Ginny Weasley was not a Horcrux even though Tom Riddle's soul occupied and possessed her -- it was the diary itself that was the Horcrux. Therefore, Voldemort could have disposed of the reincarnate Tom Riddle without harming himself. There ain't room in this world for the both of them ;)",

        "question": "Why was Hermione not in Ravenclaw?",
        "question_body": "She's clearly the smartest person in her year, and the defining trait of Ravenclaw is intelligence. Why would she be in Gryffindor rather than Ravenclaw?",
        "answer": "The Sorting Hat actually spent a long time deliberating over Hermione. She mentions it when somebody asks her about a particularly complicated piece of magic in Order of the Phoenix : “How come you’re not in Ravenclaw?” he [Terry Boot] demanded, staring at Hermione with something close to wonder. “With brains like yours?” “Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting,” said Hermione brightly, “but it decided on Gryffindor in the end.” This is a rare event, but not unheard of. Pottermore has some more information on other borderline candidates: Hatstall. An archaic Hogwarts term for any new student whose Sorting takes longer than five minutes. This is an exceptionally long time for the Sorting Hat to deliberate, and occurs rarely, perhaps once every fifty years. Of Harry Potter’s contemporaries, Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom came closest to being Hatstalls. The Sorting Hat spent nearly four minutes trying to decide whether it should place Hermione in Ravenclaw or Gryffindor. As for why Hermione is sorted into Gryffindor over Ravenclaw, I think she answers this herself in Philosopher’s Stone . On the Hogwarts Express, she shows a clear preference for Gryffindor over Ravenclaw: ”I’ve been asking around and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best, I hear Dumbledore himself was one, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad…” We know the Sorting Hat takes your choice into account, so if it was struggling to place her, then it might use her preference as the deciding factor. Later, in the dungeons as they’re trying to get to the Philosopher’s Stone, we have this particularly telling line: “I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. “Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more important things – friendship and bravery and – oh Harry – be careful!” Hermione holds the values of Gryffindor – courage and bravery – higher than those of Ravenclaw – raw intelligence and knowledge . She doesn’t just value these traits; she exhibits them throughout the books. She encourages Harry to start Dumbledore’s Army; she fights with him in the Ministry of Magic; she works alongside him in the hunt for Horcruxes. But she starts off as a stereotypical know-it-all, and we don’t really see much courage or bravery. The Sorting Hat placed her in Gryffindor because she has the traits of a Gryffindor within her, and placing her in that house can bring them out. She’s already very studious and intelligent, more so than a lot of Ravenclaws, so I think she has more to gain from Gryffindor than Ravenclaw.",

        "question": "Why is JK Rowling considered 'bad at math'?",
        "question_body": "An often repeated meme about Harry Potter is that JK Rowling is 'bad at math'. I see this all over this site and the saying is probably used elsewhere. The following is said, in the comments for the selected answer for \"How had the Potters 'thrice defied him'?\" Hasn't it been mentioned before that JKR has said she is bad with math? And here she says she counts. Almost scary. And apparently JK Rowling agrees in another question \"What is JK Rowling “bad” at?\" JKR : In the world? Oh, Emerson, my maths is so bad. Are there any particular examples that drive this meme? Why is JK Rowling considered so 'bad at math'?",
        "answer": "Dates From alexwlchan's excellent answer here (emphasis mine): I know that Harry Potter Wikia isn’t usually considered canon, but they have a list of dating contradictions which looks fairly accurate. To me, most of this list can be written off as JK Rowling's dodgy maths , but I thought I'd pick on one example. For example, in Goblet of Fire , we have Friday the 30th of October and Tuesday the 22nd of November. If you look at a calendar, you see that 22 Nov falls 23 days after 30 Oct , so the 22nd is a Sunday in the Gregorian calendar. There are many possibilities: Whoops, JK Rowling messed up. Their weekdays occur in a different order to ours. The magical calendar puts extra days at the end of October. There are some \"glue\" days between months to make up the difference. Unclear as to whether to start months from the 0th or the 1st day , they compromised and count November from the (-1) st . At some point, several days were dropped, 1 but nobody thought this was remarkable or unusual. I think the only plausible explanation is (1). More details from that HP Wikia page on dating contradictions (emphasis mine): Often when dates are given, they are given with a day of the week that does not match with that date as it in actual history. One such example occurs in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban when Sybill Trelawney refers to 16 October as Friday, although 16 October 1993 was a Saturday . This is usually explained as artistic licence on the author's part. There are also contradictions within the books in this area. For example, in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , both 1 September and 2 September are given as Mondays and, in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , Buckbeak's trial is set on 20 April, but careful parsing of the text reveals that it could have happened no later than February. Also, if an anachronism counts as a dating error, then we have How could Dudley have wrecked his PlayStation if the PlayStation didn't exist yet? : Harry was born in 1980. Therefore, the fourth book should be set in 1994. Yet, Harry mentions in his letter to Sirius that Dudley chucked his new PlayStation out of the window. The only problem is that the PlayStation wasn't on the market in Britain at that time. Population statistics From Slytherincess's excellent answer here : I think we have to take the number of students at Hogwarts with a grain of salt. J.K. Rowling has discrepancies in her numbers, and she admits she is \"horrible at maths,\" but at one point it was put forth that there are approximately 1000 students at Hogwarts, which would break down to approximately 250 students per house. There's a short article on how many students there are at Hogwarts here . The number of students in each house does indeed seem evenly distributed. However, the answers to During the events of the Harry Potter series what is the total population of Wizards/Witches globally? contradict both this and each other. In particular, one of them mentions two very clearly contradictory statements from JKR: Also, J. K. Rowling has stated that she imagines the wizarding population of the U.K. to be around 3,000. This estimate, although seemingly small, is understandable; a larger population would be far harder to hide from Muggles. However, she also stated that the number of students attending Hogwarts was around 1,000, which seems inconsistent with the population estimate. Here are the words of JKR herself in the famous \"Oh, Emerson, my maths is so bad\" interview : I sat down and I created 40 kids who enter Harry's year. [...] I never consciously thought, “That's it, that' s all the people in his year,” but that's kind of how it's worked out. Then I've been asked a few times how many people and because numbers are not my strong point, one part of my brain knew 40, and another part of my brain said, “Oh, about 600 sounds right.” Then people started working it out and saying, \"Where are the other kids sleeping?\" [...] But if you assume that all of the wizarding children are being sent to Hogwarts, then that's very few wizard-to-Muggle population, isn’t it? There will be the odd kid whose parents don't want them to go to Hogwarts, but 600 out of the whole of Britain is tiny. Let's say three thousand [in Britain], actually, thinking about it, and then think of all the magical creatures, some of which appear human. [...] That's going to bump you up a bit as well, so it's a more sizable, total magical community that needs hiding, concealing, but don't hold me to these figures, because that's not how I think. The problems with, and contradictions between, these figures have been much more extensively discussed in Shisa's excellent answer to Why is the intake of students for Hogwarts so small compared to the number of witches and wizards in Britain? . (As an amusing side-note, after the above-quoted paragraphs, the subject was quickly changed to lovey-dovey stuff, on which JKR was much happier to expound.) Miscellaneous How could Hermione have gotten more OWLs than classes? Apparently JKR originally wrote Hermione as having taken twelve OWLs, even though she was only taking ten classes from her fourth year onwards. What age did Dumbledore live to? Slytherincess's answer here highlights contradictions between different JKR statements on Dumbledore's age. Why doesn't Hogwarts have more teachers? The number of teachers and students at Hogwarts doesn't really work out to give every teacher a realistic workload. (Admittedly JKR is far from alone among authors of kids' school novels in making this sort of story-simplifying 'error'.) The Weasleys' ages. (This link was actually mentioned by alexwlchan in the first answer quoted above, but I thought it was worth including as its own example.) JKR once messed up the numbers for the age difference between the Weasley boys, specifically Charlie and Percy. Hat tip to DVK on meta and Valorum in a comment and alexwlchan in an answer for pointing me in the direction of some of these maths errors.",

        "question": "Is Slytherin Evil?",
        "question_body": "Maybe I'm just hearing the wrong comments, but it seems that Slytherin is considered a dark house by almost everyone. I know when both reading the books and watching the movies, I always had a feeling of foreboding when there were a number of Slytherin house members around or the time when Harry and friends went into Slytherin and felt this feeling was emphasized by the writing and film directing. We hear very little positive about Slytherin (other than the repeated line that Harry would be a great wizard if he went in Slytherin) and there really isn't a list of great wizards who were in Slytherin House. Even in the movie Deathly Hallows (I can't check the book - I loaned it to my sister 3 weeks after it was published and haven't seen it since!), McGonagall specifically asks Filtch to lead all the Slytherin students into the dungeon while Hogwarts is under siege by Voldemort. She doesn't specify that any Slytherin students remain behind to help fight. Is this intentional? Did JKR intentionally create a bad reputation and not present any counter-examples so we'd believe all of Slytherin was bad? Most characters in the Potter-verse are complex. While we can admire James and Lily Potter, we also see how James teased and taunted Snape, showing us a harsh side of James, and we see that there is good in Snape. We even see complexity in Voldemort as a villain who is mixed-blood, but hates those of mixed blood and wants purity for all witches and wizards. With all the complex characters, it seems odd that there is essentially nothing to redeem the House of Slytherin - which is not just one character, but is a group represented by a number of characters. But yet it seems as if it's presented, in both books and movies, as dark and full of schemers and bad people. Are there indications, and especially more than a few or just tiny ones, that there are a fair number of good witches and wizards in Slytherin?",
        "answer": "Let's have a shout out for Slytherin House! Several great examples have already been given regarding Slytherins that aren't one-dimensional evil villains. Under the spoilers tag is the Slytherin welcome letter from Pottermore (and note that Pottermore is still in beta, so you can only access it if you have a beta account -- some here might, some might not), which contains information relevant to this question. I'm going to edit a few bits, as it's quite a long letter. Here's what J.K. Rowling has to say about Slytherin House: Congratulations! I’m Prefect Gemma Farley, and I’m delighted to welcome you to SLYTHERIN HOUSE. Our emblem is the serpent, the wisest of creatures; our house colours are emerald green and silver, and our common room lies behind a concealed entrance down in the dungeons. As you’ll see, its windows look out into the depths of the Hogwarts lake. We often see the giant squid swooshing by – and sometimes more interesting creatures. We like to feel that our hangout has the aura of a mysterious, underwater shipwreck. Now, there are a few things you should know about Slytherin – and a few you should forget. Firstly, let’s dispel a few myths. You might have heard rumours about Slytherin house – that we’re all into the Dark Arts, and will only talk to you if your great-grandfather was a famous wizard, and rubbish like that. Well, you don’t want to believe everything you hear from competing houses. I’m not denying that we’ve produced our share of Dark wizards, but so have the other three houses – they just don’t like admitting it. And yes, we have traditionally tended to take students who come from long lines of witches and wizards, but nowadays you’ll find plenty of people in Slytherin house who have at least one Muggle parent. Here’s a little-known fact that the other three houses don’t bring up much: Merlin was a Slytherin. Yes, Merlin himself, the most famous wizard in history! He learned all he knew in this very house! Do you want to follow in the footsteps of Merlin? Or would you rather sit at the old desk of that illustrious ex-Hufflepuff, Eglantine Puffett, inventor of the Self-Soaping Dishcloth? I didn’t think so. But that’s enough about what we’re not. Let’s talk about what we are, which is the coolest and edgiest house in this school. We play to win, because we care about the honour and traditions of Slytherin. We also get respect from our fellow students. Yes, some of that respect might be tinged with fear, because of our Dark reputation, but you know what? It can be fun, having a reputation for walking on the wild side. Chuck out a few hints that you’ve got access to a whole library of curses, and see whether anyone feels like nicking your pencil case. But we’re not bad people. We’re like our emblem, the snake: sleek, powerful, and frequently misunderstood. For instance, we Slytherins look after our own – which is more than you can say for Ravenclaw. Apart from being the biggest bunch of swots you ever met, Ravenclaws are famous for clambering over each other to get good marks, whereas we Slytherins are brothers. The corridors of Hogwarts can throw up surprises for the unwary, and you’ll be glad you’ve got the Serpents on your side as you move around the school. As far as we’re concerned, once you’ve become a snake, you’re one of ours – one of the elite. Because you know what Salazar Slytherin looked for in his chosen students? The seeds of greatness. You’ve been chosen by this house because you’ve got the potential to be great, in the true sense of the word. All right, you might see a couple of people hanging around the common room whom you might not think are destined for anything special. Well, keep that to yourself. If the Sorting Hat put them in here, there’s something great about them, and don’t you forget it. Examples of Slytherins who were not evil: Horace Slughorn -- Potions Master and Head of House for Slytherin once Snape became Headmaster. Severus Snape -- gave his life in the service of the Order of the Phoenix. Andromeda Black Tonks -- Sister of Bellatrix Black Lestrange and Narcissa Black Malfoy, married a Muggleborn, Ted Tonks, despite being written off by her family. Regulus Black -- Brother to Sirius Black. Regulus joined the Death Eaters at a very young age, but found he was in over his head. He ultimately discovered Voldemort was making Horcruxes and stole the Slytherin locket Horcrux, replacing it with a fake Horcrux. Phineas Nigellus -- Slytherin Hogwarts Headmaster portrait. Phineas seems to be helpful to Dumbledore, although he is snide, prejudiced, and judgmental of others. Draco Malfoy -- While not a nice guy, Draco chooses not to turn the trio over to the Death Eaters when they were captured by Fenrir Greyback in Deathly Hallows , and he chooses to not kill Dumbledore in Half-Blood Prince , risking death at the hand of Voldemort each time. Theodore Nott -- \"Raised by a very elderly widower and Death Eater father, Theodore is a clever loner who does not feel the need to join gangs, including Malfoy's. Theodore is just as pure-blooded as [Draco] is, and somewhat cleverer\" J.K. Rowling Slytherin students are cunning, ambitious, resourceful, determined, and have a certain disregard for the rules ;) ETA: Someone in the comments indicated he/she doesn't think J.K. Rowling wrote the Slytherin House greeting letter. I think she did, but all I can offer is this screenshot of Pottermore's Sorting Hat page that appears before you click on the link to get your welcome letter: (POTTERMORE SPOILERS) || LINK ||",

        "question": "What plot points are missing in the Harry Potter movies that are in the novels?",
        "question_body": "I know that the movies were written to be a stand alone universe on their own, but what key elements were missing in the movies that were vital in the books that viewers are missing out on?",
        "answer": "Here’s an incomplete list of the biggest things I can remember that were omitted or simplified significantly in the movies versus the books. The whole post is riddled with spoilers so I won’t even try masking them; you have been warned: Overall: Probably the largest single overt omission from the entire movie series was the character of Peeves the Poltergeist. He plays a relatively minor role in most of the books, but the comic relief would have been good in areas, and his role became more important in book 5 and book 7 as he actively fought against the bad guys. The movies in general leave out a LOT of Quidditch matches from the books. The existence of Squibs (non-magic children of wizarding parents; the reverse of a Muggle-born) is never explicitly stated, though the characters of Filch and Mrs Figg (both Squibs) are present. Book 1: The Sorcerer’s Stone movie is probably the closest overall to the book, as the book is the shortest. They miss an entire game of Quidditch against Hufflepuff; it’s notable because Snape referees the game, piling suspicion on him, and thus Harry’s under pressure to end the game quickly. He catches the Snitch in less than five minutes, which has to be some kind of record. The film simplified how Harry and Hermione get caught out of bed at night, meaning Neville isn’t out with them in the Forbidden Forest (simplifying that scene). The characters of Bane and Magorian are omitted. In the book, a couple of conversations introduce the centaurs as star-gazers and a very proud race. Malfoy doesn’t challenge Harry to a duel in the movie; this simplifies their discovery of what’s behind the door on the third floor. They skip two of the puzzles in the dungeons (one of which takes about a paragraph in the books; another troll, which is sound asleep when they get there), and simplify how they deal with Fluffy (there’s a harp that’s already playing magically). Instead of using fire to push away the roots of The Devil's Snare which was grabbing them, Hermione tells Harry and Ron to calm down and relax. In the book, the final fight in the mirror chamber ends with Harry blacking out from the pain in his scar, locked in a death grip with Quirrell just as Dumbledore comes upon the scene. We’re told that Quirrell died as part of the exposition in the infirmary, as well as a few other things, including some tantalizing missing information about why Voldemort would want to kill Harry in the first place. Book 2: The second movie was shot pretty faithfully. A few things are simplified and a couple things are switched around, but I can’t remember much that was overtly omitted other than: The side trip to Filch’s office early in the book, in which the audience learns about Squibs and that Filch is one, never happens. Sir Nicholas’s 500th death-day party on Halloween night was omitted; in the book, HH&R’s attendance of this party leads to them finding Mrs. Norris, petrified and hanging by her tail, at just the wrong time. The movie uses a combination of Harry’s detention with Gilderoy Lockhart and a chance meeting with Hermione and Ron to accomplish the same effect. Book 3: Probably got the biggest cuts in regard to Quidditch when going to movie form; in the book, the Quidditch matches are very important plot points concerning Harry’s weakness with dementors and his learning of the Patronus Charm. In the book, Harry and the Gryffindor team overcome Harry’s first-ever honest loss in Quidditch during the match against Hufflepuff and Cedric Diggory (in which he fell off his broom due to the dementors, the one scene the movie does show), to win the Quidditch Cup for the first time in ten years by beating Slytherin. Harry also is able to use his new Firebolt in that match against Slytherin, after having it confiscated by McGonagall when he first got it under suspicion of it being sent by Sirius Black (still thought to be Harry’s mortal enemy). The movie ends with him taking it for his first spin, with a hint that Sirius sent it (a hippogriff feather with it). The replacement of the Fat Lady with Sir Cadogan after Black’s first intrusion into the castle was omitted; this also omits the incident where Sirius actually gets into the Gryffindor dormitory. The exposition of Sirius as Harry’s godfather, and that he apparently betrayed his parents to Voldemort, was drastically simplified. Also, the snowball fight was actually a mudball fight, and Harry’s cloak comes askew so Malfoy sees his head floating in mid-air, meaning Harry has to dash back to Hogwarts to avoid being caught. Harry takes many more lessons to properly learn to cast the Patronus Charm. The meeting in the Shrieking Shack was cut down a bit, and there were some other inconsistencies (this movie actually added more than it removed in the way of small details, if I remember right, in order to add some time and comic relief on events that play out much more quickly in the books, like getting past the Whomping Willow). The fact that Lupin, Pettigrew, Sirius and James (Mssr’s Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs) were childhood friends is implied throughout the movies but they never went into much detail; the third book has a lot of exposition about these four. Exactly who wrote the Marauders’ Map is implied by Lupin’s familiarity with it, but it’s explained more explicitly in the book. Book 4: Harry’s leaving the Dursleys’ to go to the World Cup is omitted; in the book, the Weasleys try to connect Harry’s house to the Floo network, but the Dursleys have an electric fireplace insert that blocks their path, and Arthur ends up destroying half the Dursleys’ living room in the process of extricating them. The fact that Cedric beat Harry in their Quidditch match last year (because Harry fell off his broom under the effects of the dementors) was omitted because it wasn’t mentioned in movie 3 (it’s implied, not very well, that the match was stopped after Harry fell). This gets Cedric and Harry off to a rocky start in the books. Ludo Bagman is just a big red herring in the books and is absent from the films. Because he’s not there, the Weasley twins take over the undertone of gambling on the Triwizard Tournament. We get scenes from the World Cup, but we never actually get to see the game being played. This is in keeping with the general reduction of the role of Quidditch in the films compared to the books. Harry and the Weasleys are in the Minister’s box as well, alongside the Malfoys, instead of in the upper deck. Dobby’s role is cut out completely (the hint to use gillyweed instead played out the way Moody had intended it to in the book, with Neville telling him after being given a book on Herbology by Moody), as is the side story about S.P.E.W. and Winky which feeds into a much more complex story concerning Barty Crouch and his son. Pretty much all the challenges play out slightly differently, but the spirit is there. Charlie Weasley’s character is omitted as an acted part; he’s only referred to in film 1, but he has a bit part in both books 1 and 4. Rita Skeeter’s poking around and truth-distortion is hinted at but much reduced; the fact that she’s an Animagus and used her talent to literally be a fly on the wall was completely ignored. The dragon Harry faces in the book is not chained, and is much less aggressive, but stays rooted on her nest most of the time because she’s a nesting mother (which is the challenge for the contestants, to get the egg away from a very defensive dragon). The judges’ ratings are pretty much ignored until the last challenge, and that last challenge is very different (the original maze is much more of a true obstacle course, with a lot of magical beasts and other tricks). The Blast-Ended Skrewts are completely absent because they’re no longer needed for the last challenge. Cedric and Harry are much more sportsmanlike to each other in the book; the point of the change of the maze itself in the film was to sorely test that because the movie didn’t have the initial enmity between these characters over their last Quidditch game. In the book, Harry saves Cedric, but is injured and unable to make it to the cup; Cedric is faced with the choice Harry had in the film, of taking the Triwizard Cup for himself or helping Harry. There’s more Pensieve scenes in the book than the movie; it’s condensed in the film to one scene that tells you everything you need to know, in the process removing Ludo’s backstory and the original introduction to the audience of the character of Bellatrix Lestrange. Fudge’s denial and blatant coverup of the events in the maze (including Barty Jr’s ultimate fate) are omitted; the essentials are instead given to the audience in film 5. Book 5: This book was trimmed right down to the barest elements; I think it’s actually the longest in the entire series, but they condense it to just 2 and a half hours of movie. As such, there’s a LOT missing: The events leading up to Harry coming to Grimmauld Place are condensed a bit, especially the confrontation with the Dursleys over what happened to Dudley. Tonks’ being a Metamorphmagus is hinted at but never fully explained or made much use of other than comic relief. The cleaning of the Black house (including the later-important detail of the locket being binned) was cut out completely. It is also during this chapter, I believe, where we’re originally given the name Regulus Black; Sirius’s younger brother and a key “non-character” in later books. The movies give the first mention of this name to Slughorn as a throwaway line in HBP. Percy’s estrangement from the Weasleys from the book is largely ignored in the film; he’s the one holding Harry in Dumbledore’s office when Ms. Umbridge confronts Dumbledore about the DA, and thus he’s an enemy, but besides a sideways glance by Harry at his captor, that fact is never overtly brought to the audience’s attention. The assignment of prefects in the fifth year is omitted, along with the fact that Ron was chosen for Gryffindor over Harry for that honor. Quidditch is completely absent from the film; it’s implied that the disbanding of school activity groups includes a blanket ban on Quidditch. In the book, Harry’s banned from playing after the first game, in which Malfoy’s taunting gets to him and the Weasley twins, provoking a fight. Ron first gets the Keeper job in Book 5 instead of movie 6, but isn’t very good at it (prompting a Slytherin song: “Weasley Is Our King”). Harry’s crush for Cho is ended in a different way in the book, after a disastrous date. Cho herself doesn’t betray Dumbledore’s Army as in the movie (however unintentional on Cho’s part), but she does call Hermione out for using such a terrible curse against Cho’s friend (who DID betray them), which pretty much ends their relationship when Harry comes to Hermione’s defense. Rita Skeeter is absent in this film; in the book, she writes a true account, exactly as Harry tells it, of the night in the graveyard at the end of book 4, which is published in the Quibbler and gets Harry in a LOT of trouble with Umbridge. The Weasleys cause a lot more chaos in the book before they leave Hogwarts, and it’s not known at first that they’re doing it (at least not to Umbridge and the Inquisitorial Squad), until they’re caught turning a corridor into a bog. Harry’s “guidance counselor” meeting with McGonagall, which Umbridge sits in on and in which Harry states his desire to be an Auror, is omitted completely from the film. This tidbit is first given in movie 6, more or less true to that book. In the book, Harry, Hermione and Ron visit St Mungo’s to see Arthur Weasley after the snake attack, in the process running into their old DADA teacher from book 2, Gilderoy Lockhart, who is a long-term patient there after the backfired Memory Charm. The fact Arthur was at St Mungo’s at all is glossed over in the movie. Harry’s spending the Christmas holidays at Grimmauld Place is trimmed; Snape meets him there to tell him about his upcoming Occlumency lessons. In the film, St Mungo’s is skipped entirely, and so the Occlumency lessons commence immediately once it’s clear Harry is seeing into Voldemort’s mind. Firenze’s part in Book 5 is completely omitted from the film, as is the subplot of Professor Trelawney having a taste for cooking sherry leading up to her being sacked. The centaurs were portrayed much more simply in the movie, and the fact that one centaur, Bane, wanted to kill Harry and Hermione as well (for having the centaurs do their dirty work) was omitted. Dumbledore projects a little more outward emotion over what Umbridge is doing to his school in the film than the book, and seems less confident in her presence. Harry has a lot more lessons with Snape than are shown, and is kicked out of them because he purposely looked at Snape’s memories in the Pensieve, not because he saw them by accident using the Shield Charm to rebound the Legilimens Charm (though that does happen). The OWL testing is hinted at in the movies, but there’s much more in the books; all the practical spellcasting including another Patronus shot right at Umbridge, Harry fainting and seeing Sirius tortured during his History of Magic test, seeing Hagrid attacked during Astronomy; all omitted. The Department of Mysteries is much simpler in the movie, mainly centering around the Hall of Prophecy and the Ampitheatre. All the little oddities in some of the other rooms in the book, and the role they play in the fight, are omitted. The fight itself is slightly truncated as a result; there were more of the kids still able to fight when the Order shows up in the movie than the book. Bellatrix uses Avada Kedavra on Sirius, which causes him to keel over into the veil. The fight between Voldemort and Dumbledore is changed; the spirit is there but the spells and other events are perhaps more visually impacting. Dumbledore’s explanation to Harry after the events in the Ministry is cut WAY down. In the book, that’s an entire long chapter basically explaining Dumbledore’s behavior from the very first book up to the present, including why Voldemort wanted to kill a one-year-old Harry in the first place, and which also features a full-out raging teenage meltdown on Harry’s part. Book 6: The movie was closer in spirit than 3, 4 or 5, but as the second-longest book (and the one with the most exposition) it was cut considerably as well: The opening chapters of Book 6 give you the same information presented in the movie, but in a very different format involving the Muggle Prime Minister. Bill and Fleur’s courtship, and the angst that causes the Weasleys, especially Molly, is absent from the film. We’re not even told about Bill in the films until DH part 1. The subtext of Harry’s Auror ambitions is present but diminished in the film. We don’t see Harry’s OWL grades, but we’re told the basic information we need to know about why he hadn’t signed up for Potions, and thus how the HBP’s Potions book comes into his hands. Snape is now the DADA teacher, and the sixth years are expected to begin mastering nonverbal spells. These facts are skipped in the film. The book had a lot more memories that Dumbledore had collected, relating to what Tom Riddle was doing in his late years at Hogwarts and immediately after leaving school. Levicorpus is just another spell, not one of the HBP’s inventions. In fact, it was actually first used in film 5 (Luna uses it on a Death Eater at the Ministry), when it isn’t introduced to readers by name until book 6 when Harry uses it accidentally on Ron. The fact that Katie Bell was a Chaser for Gryffindor gets one throwaway mention in the movie, and the fact that her being out for several weeks hindered Harry’s Quidditch team was completely ignored. The character of Katie as portrayed in the film was much younger; she should be a seventh-year by this point, the last remaining member of the team from books 1-3, but the casting made her look more like a fifth- or sixth-year. Cormac McLaggen had a bigger role in the books, primarily in the omitted second Gryffindor game of the season, where McLaggen is such a bad team player and such a know-it-all about Quidditch that he ends up taking Harry out with a bludger in the second game of the season. In the book, Felix Felicis doesn’t make you act as drunk or loopy as Harry was in the movie, and Slughorn isn’t stealing Tentacula leaves when Harry meets him. Apparition lessons with Wilkie Twycross from the Ministry are omitted, though Apparition itself is present at key points in the story. In the book, whether Ron is going to live or die after being poisoned is much more in doubt; in the movie, he sits right up and cracks a joke. The next scene, where Ron says Hermione’s name in his sleep causing Lavender to break up with him, is not true to the book, though she is offended that nobody thought to tell what had happened to Ron, and Ron begins feigning sleep when she later comes to see him in hospital. Rufus Scrimgeour visits Harry at the Burrow over Christmas, with Percy Weasley in tow, to try to recruit him as a poster boy for the Ministry (much like Fudge did) and to try to learn from Harry where Dumbledore keeps disappearing off to; the readers learn that Umbridge still works for the Ministry, and that not much has changed in the world of magical politics after Fudge’s ouster. After the incident in the prefect’s bathroom with Sectumsempra, Harry has to hide the book in a hurry, and he does it himself by going to the Room of Requirement, finding a place to stash it and then decorating a nearby bust with a wig and tiara to mark it. That tiara later becomes important. Snape sentences Harry to detention every Saturday for the rest of the year after the Sectumsempra incident. Because of this, he can’t play the last game of the season, and has precious little time with Ginny. This omission is part of a general slowdown of the blooming relationship between Harry and Ginny. Harry’s feelings for Ginny are more manifest in the book, but shown in different ways. Because the celebration of Gryffindor winning the Quidditch Cup isn’t shown in the movie, Harry can’t kiss Ginny in front of Ron (and the rest of Gryffindor House) in the middle of it, which would have been funny to see. The return of Harry and Dumbledore to Hogwarts after their field trip is simplified. In the book, they Apparate to Hogsmeade (because in the books not even Dumbledore can Apparate within the Hogwarts grounds), and Rosmerta, the bartender at the Three Broomsticks (who is under the Imperius Curse via Malfoy) urges them to get to Hogwarts as fast as possible using some brooms she gives them, leading to them arriving at the Astronomy Tower. The fact that Snape was Harry’s Occlumency teacher, and that Harry was so poor at it, was ignored in the confrontation between Harry and Snape at the end of the film. The fact that Snape is the Half-Blood Prince is divulged here much as it is in the book. Harry and Hagrid putting out Hagrid’s house with their wands after it was set on fire was skipped, as was the exposition about Snape’s witch mother, Eileen Snape nee Prince. Dumbledore’s funeral is omitted from the movie. Because of this, and the fact that in the movies Ginny and Harry aren’t publicly an item, Harry formally breaking up with Ginny (because he knows he’s not coming back to school and that Ginny can’t come with them) is also skipped; instead this is where the audience learns of Ron’s tacit approval of Harry and Ginny being together. Book 7: … was pretty close on screen, compared to the last few, but that’s because they had two movies - over 4 and a half hours - to tell the story. The main things missed were: Ginny kissing Harry at the Burrow is a bigger twist; they’ve officially broken up, but obviously not for any love lost between them. Ron breaks it up instead of George, chastises Harry for leading her on, and takes steps to make sure they’re not alone together again until the wedding party is crashed. In the book, Scrimgeour interrupts Harry’s birthday party at the Burrow (which itself was skipped in the film), first to try to get information from Harry about Dumbledore’s death and the Order, and second, to read Dumbledore’s will (which is seen in DH Part 1). Scrimgeour in the film has a little less animosity toward HH&R than is stated in the books, but he is still rather short with them; it’s taken as part of his character. Harry is himself in the film during the wedding; in the book, just to be safe, he’s given doses of Polyjuice Potion to look like a redheaded boy from the nearby village, and is passed off as yet another Weasley cousin. HH&R Apparate to Tottenham Court Road in the book, but it’s given as Shaftesbury Avenue in the film, with Hermione saying she used to go to the theater with her parents. Road names in London are a bit odd, due to the age and history of the city, and the road now systematically known as A400 includes parts of both historic streets. This isn’t a major crime, as the establishing shot is the very famous Picadilly Circus where Shaftesbury starts, which is a few blocks southwest of the major theaters on Shaftesbury. Tottenham Court Road proper is only a few blocks north of there following Charing Cross (also part of A400). The discussion with Elphias and Ron’s great aunt is longer. In fact, the entire tarnishing of Dumbledore’s shining reputation and the introduction of his backstory was a subtext almost completely removed from the films, with only the barest elements given to the audience where it’s absolutely essential. This results in a reduction in Aberforth’s part late in the second film, and of Dumbledore’s at “King’s Cross”. Viktor Krum is in attendance at the wedding in the book, having been invited by Fleur. Harry makes the leap that Gregorovitch is the wandmaker that Voldemort is looking for after remembering that Krum’s wand was made by Gregorovitch (from WAY back in Book 4 during the weighing of the wands). Harry, Hermione and Ron spend more time at Grimmauld Place planning the raid on the Ministry, and Kreacher actually warms to them after the confrontation in the kitchen over the locket and Mundungus Fletcher, before HH&R are forced never to return after escaping the Ministry. Tonks and Lupin being engaged/married is brushed over in the films. In the book, it’s a much bigger subtext; Lupin shows up at Grimmauld Place while HH&R are planning their infiltration of the Ministry, and we learn he wants to leave Tonks because she’s pregnant, and he’s afraid what the child will be (he’s a werewolf after all). Then, while HH&R recuperate at Shell Cottage later, Lupin stops by and gives the news that it’s a boy, and asks Harry to be godfather. All of this was removed from the film plot, which I think was a mistake; it removes some of the power of the events of the fight. Phineas Nigellus is absent from the film (and pretty much all others; he has a bit part in book 5 as well). This forces the film to be very vague about how Snape could have known where they were to get the sword to them; there are memory images in the Pensieve scene but no details. In the book, the spark for Ron leaving Harry and Hermione is an omitted conversation between Tonks’ father and two ex-Gringotts goblins, overheard by Harry, Ron and Hermione while camping, regarding what’s been happening in the outside world (particularly to Ginny, the last Weasley at Hogwarts). Harry had to make a conscious decision in the book, choosing Horcruxes over Hallows, by choosing to stay at Shell Cottage to get the information he needed from Griphook and Ollivander, instead of acting on the knowledge he has through his connection to Voldemort regarding where the Elder Wand is and that Voldemort also knows. In the film, there was never a chance that Harry could have gotten to the Elder Wand first; HH&R were still recovering from shock and injury from the events at Malfoy Manor. At Gringott’s, Harry uses a few more Imperio charms in the book, and also Confunds a few guards at the door. In the Lestrange vault at Gringott’s in the book, the treasure has not only been guarded with Geminio, but also the Flagrante curse, which causes the copies to be burning hot to the touch, making HH&R’s entrapment in the burgeoning treasure that much more painful. Griphook’s role in the movie is close to the book; in the book we’re not told he’s killed at Gringott’s, which I think is a good foreshadowing, as Neville getting the Gryffindor sword from the Sorting Hat at the very end could be confusing to a reader who knows it was last seen in Griphook’s hands. The Carrows are omitted from the movies as speaking roles, through they’re mentioned in the right place in the film and it’s inferred the two of them are the ones flanking Snape in the Great Hall; in the books they’ve taken over Muggle Studies and the class formerly known as Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Harry uses Crucio on one of them in Ravenclaw Tower to protect McGonagall (for the first time seeing what Bellatrix meant: “you have to mean an Unforgivable Curse”). McGonagall also uses an Unforgivable ( Imperio ) on the other Carrow in the same scene of the book, showing that Harry’s uses of them in several situations, while extreme, are not unique among the good guys and so not necessarily “unforgivable”. In the book, after the Grey Lady (Helena Ravenclaw) confirms that Tom found her mother’s diadem and brought it back to Hogwarts as a Horcrux, Harry remembers putting a tiara on the bust he used to mark the location of the Half-Blood Prince’s potions book; that’s what allows him to find the tiara again. The film simplifies this by inferring Harry is attuned to the Horcruxes and can sense their presence. Most of the battle plays out slightly differently; the whole scene with Neville on the bridge isn’t in the book, and there aren’t as many of the past characters shown in the movie as the book has. Colin, Wood, Lavender, Cho, Percy, Bill, Charlie, Alicia Spinnett, Katie Bell, even Grawp and Kreacher are all mentioned, and Percy gets a reconciliation with his parents before the fight. Different people are in different places, and different things happen, but the spirit is there. I did want to see Professor McGonagall directing a herd of animated classroom desks down the hall with a most un-McGonagall-esque “CHAAAAARGE!”; her use of Transfiguration in the film was limited to one spell animating the suits of armor (more like statues in the film). More Pensieve memories in the book than the film, of course, though they showed more than I thought they would in the movie. The film simplified how Petunia became so virulently anti-magic, why Lily falls away from Snape at school, and how Harry got the Sword of Gryffindor. There’s also a minor plot point in the book where we find out who ransacked Grimmauld Place (besides Mundungus) and why half of a letter from Lily to Sirius was missing, as well as half of a picture. The scene at “King’s Cross” in Harry’s mind is truncated, mostly omitting the parts where Dumbledore fills in the remaining blank spots of his backstory; this entire subtext was largely absent from both parts of DH on screen. The killing of Nagini is much more straightforward in the book; Neville breaks a “Full Body-Bind” curse Voldemort puts on him, pulls the Sorting Hat off his head (Voldemort put the hat on him and set it ablaze while Neville was paralyzed), draws the sword from it and chops the snake’s head off before the battle even starts up again. The film draws it out to a last-minute thing. In the book, the centaurs and other creatures from the Hogwarts grounds join in once the battle starts up again. Their role is omitted, though we do see the spiders attacking earlier in the battle, having been driven out of the Forbidden Forest by Voldemort’s forces. In the film, the audience learns why the last standoff between Voldemort and Harry plays out the way it does after the fact, instead of while the two are staring each other down as in the book (though Harry hints to Voldemort that he knows why the Elder Wand won’t work for him). I actually think that works better for the movie, but in the book, the slow-burn realization that Voldemort has lost this final duel before it even starts is a nice touch. In the book, Harry is able to use the Elder Wand to repair his old holly-and-phoenix-feather wand (which was snapped in Part 1). In the movie, it’s implied he simply continues to use the one he stole from Draco. Instead of snapping the Elder Wand outright, in the book Harry simply chooses to place it back with Dumbledore in the tomb and let nature take its course. If Harry dies a natural death, the wand’s power will be broken. Harry’s rejection of the Elder Wand’s power is more forceful in the film, and also more in keeping with his ambitions to become an Auror (a job which, as is illustrated many times, doesn’t lend itself to a peaceful death in bed at a hundred and twenty years old). The “Nineteen Years Later” epilogue is slightly trimmed; Ron, who’s married Hermione, talks about passing a Muggle driving test, almost without having to Confund the tester. Harry and Ginny, who have three children, are informed rather unceremoniously that Tonks and Lupin’s son Teddy apparently fancies Bill and Fleur’s daughter Victoire, which is a little too close for comfort for Harry’s eldest son James, seeing as Teddy is Harry’s godson and so a regular at the Potters’, while Victoire is a blood relative (James’s cousin). And Draco, who married as well (though we’re not told whom in the book), has a son Scorpius, who is Albus’s age.",

        "question": "Why doesn't Hogwarts have more teachers?",
        "question_body": "Hogwarts apparently has only one professor per subject. We could reason this out by looking at the fact that all of Harry's Potions classes are with Snape (for as long as Snape is teaching Potions), all of his Transfiguration classes are with McGonagall, etc., etc. Or we could observe that teachers are referred to as \"the x teacher\". Or we could simply look at the curse on the Defence Against the Dark Arts post. So why is this? And how is this? There are seven years studying at Hogwarts, divided into four houses, where do they find the time to take everybody's classes? Muggle schools have entire departments dedicated to each subject, how does Hogwarts manage with only one teacher per subject? They even manage to find time to be in the staff room when some peoples' lessons are going on. For example, in The Order of the Phoenix , when Hedwig turns up injured during History of Magic, Harry rushes down to the staff room to find Prof Grubbly-Plank and comes face-to-face with Minerva McGonagall who teaches Transfiguration (a compulsory subject for the first five years) to all year groups.",
        "answer": "Out of universe, the answer is - as it usually is - that JKR is bad at maths. She likely didn't consider the kind of workload or number of lessons that would be required for there to only be a single teacher per subject. However, let's see if we can make it work in-universe. You stated in the question that there are seven years split between four Houses, so that gives us a starting point of 28 classes. If we assume that every year and House combination (\"class\") takes every subject once per week, that's 28 lessons per week. Some subjects are taught to two Houses from the same year at once - for example, Harry and the other Gryffindors took Potions and Care of Magical Creatures with the Slytherins and Herbology with the Hufflepuffs. That may reduce the number of required lessons for some of those subjects, but not all; Potions explicitly has double periods mentioned, but I don't know if the same is true of other shared subjects, such as Care of Magical Creatures. Worst case is that it's the same amount of teaching, best case is that they save a few lessons worth of time each week. We saw in Harry's sixth year that the number of students taking certain subjects at NEWT level was considerably lower. There only appeared to be a single sixth year class taking Slughorn's Potions class, for example. It's more likely that there's only one or two NEWT classes per subject for sixth and seventh year students. If we assume four classes (or two double periods) per year for the first five years, and only two classes per year for the last two, that brings us down to 24 lessons per week. That's probably the worst case for the core subjects. Not all classes are taught to every year - Harry doesn't start Divination until year three - which would reduce the amount of lessons required per week by eight, so we're down to 16. For optional classes, some subjects such as Divination seem to be (confusingly) popular, whereas others aren't. 16 lessons is our upper limit for a subject that's optional and starts in the third year, but if only one class worth of students choose to take it each year, then that drops down to only five(!!) lessons per week. In some years, nobody opts to take a subject. I'm not sure Hagrid taught any NEWT classes to sixth years during Half-Blood Prince, for example, which would free up time in a teacher's schedule. That assumes that each class only took a subject once per week, which isn't necessarily realistic. At least in Harry's first few years he seemed to have multiple Transfiguration and Potions lessons per week. It's possible that the later years have less classroom time due to (assumed) overall greater magical proficiency, a shorter amount of time required to practice new spells, and more theoretical study being given as homework. If we assume that each class takes every subject twice per week, rather than once, then you're looking at 48 to 56 lessons per week for a core subject (e.g. Transfiguration) and perhaps ten per week for an unpopular, optional one. In conclusion, some Hogwarts teachers likely had very relaxed schedules (possibly teaching only ten or so lessons per week) and others had very, very busy schedules (possibly teaching as many as 56 lessons per week). If you're going to be a Hogwarts teacher you probably want to pick one of the less popular optional subjects (such as Muggle Studies) and avoid one of the core subjects like Transfiguration.",

        "question": "Why would Dumbledore encourage people to call Voldemort Voldemort instead of Tom Riddle?",
        "question_body": "Here is a quote from the first Harry Potter book, it's a conversation between Dumbledore and McGonagall. \"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this 'You-Know-Who' nonsense - for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.\" \"I know you haven't,\" said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\" So at this point Dumbledore says he has been trying to persuade people to call him his proper name : Voldemort . But why wouldn't he try to persuade people to call him Tom Marvolo Riddle ? Certainly this name isn't as scary as Lord Voldemort is, and would encourage people to fight against him (because Dumbledore says something like fear of a name leads to the fear of the thing itself to Harry in the end of Philosopher Stone). Furthermore, we see Dumbledore calling Voldemort Tom in his memories, when Voldemort applies for the DatDA teacher. And in OttP, during the Dumbledore-Voldemort duel, Dumbledore calls Voldemort Tom in front of Harry. So does Harry during the final duel at Hogwarts, and Voldemort replies something like How dare you ? In my opinion Harry does so to show everyone else that Voldemort is just a man. So, the question : Why would Dumbledore encourage people to call Voldemort Voldemort and not Tom Marvolo Riddle ?",
        "answer": "Dumbledore encouraged people to call him Voldemort, rather than You-Know-Who, because there was a lot of fear not just of Voldemort, but merely saying his name. If Dumbledore can remove that then when Voldemort returned - as Dumbledore suspected he would - there would hopefully be a lot more people willing to stand against him. “Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking… sir — even if the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, YouKnow-Who —” “Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.” Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 17 - The Man With Two Faces So, why not encourage them to call him by his real name? It's still essentially a crutch; you're replacing one name they're not afraid of (\"You-Know-Who\") with another name they're not afraid of (\"Tom Riddle\"). Everybody knew him as Voldemort, that's the name that all the fear - and therefore power - is attached to, and that's what Dumbledore needed to break. I do, however, find it interesting that in the first book Dumbledore says \"Voldemort\" is the \"proper name\" for him, yet insists on calling him Tom in every interaction (I can think of) between them in the later books. I suppose Dumbledore's not against trying to get in Voldemort's head, and knows that he hates anything connecting him to his Muggle past.",

        "question": "Was Harry making a big mistake with his plan for Elder Wand?",
        "question_body": "At the very end of Deathly Hallows , after Harry repaired his own wand with the Elder Wand, he tells Dumbledore's Portrait in the office: “I’m putting the Elder Wand,” he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration, “back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it. Now, this seems incredibly foolish to me. \"The previous master will never have been defeated\" would only have been assuredely true if Harry had died right after depositing the Elder Wand back into Dumbledore's Tomb. If not, Harry (the Wand owner) would still be alive, and at the risk of being Disarmed (as was shown with Harry and Draco Malfoy, it doesn't matter if the Elder Wand's owner is defeated by death or simple disarming, AND it's not even required that the Disarming would involve the Elder Wand!). So, if Harry merely put the Elder Wand back into the Tomb, and some years later, someone would disarm him (or, even worse, kill him) - then that someone would become the Elder Wand owner , either by accident or by design: By accident - Harry is likely to get into plenty of magical duels in the future. Even discounting friendly one (teaching people the Expelliramus), he plans on becoming an Auror! By design - plenty of people have been in the Great Hall hearing Harry explaining to Voldemort that he, Harry, was now the owner of the Elder Wand, so the fact of his ownership would most assuredly NOT remain a secret, inviting countless people tempted by owning the Deathstick to hunt Harry down. Oh, and the location is now also known! So \"its power will be broken\" is quite unlikely to come true! Is Harry hopelessly wrong? Or am I missing something in the above logic? Was this addressed in canon/JKR info?",
        "answer": "I personally don't think it was Harry's most cerebral moment in the series . . . I'm shocked that Hermione didn't dissuade him from placing the Elder Wand back in Dumbledore's tomb, she being uber logical. It was a risky decision on Harry's part, no matter how remote a chance of someone figuring out that Dumbledore was master of the Elder Wand, and that the wand lay in Dumbledore's tomb. After all, Dumbledore himself came to believe in The Tale of the Three Brothers -- is it inconceivable that another would come to believe the same thing? No. It's not inconceivable. Further, in the chapter King's Cross in Deathly Hallows , Dumbledore shares with Harry his own story, wherein he eschews his desire for power and the difficulty he had in managing power -- he declined offers to become the Minister for Magic, although he participated in the Wizengamot in a lesser role than Minister. Would Dumbledore even want to be buried with the Elder Wand? Maybe not. He must have had a second wand somewhere -- the wand he likely got from Ollivander when he was eleven. Would it have been more appropriate to have buried Dumbledore with his original wand? I think it might have been. After all, it had been Dumbledore's plan to turn the wand's allegiance to Snape; that it went to Draco was purely accidental. I suppose we can assume that no one recovered Dumbledore's wand -- the Elder Wand -- but I don't think Harry thought through the risks of returning Dumbledore's wand to his tomb. The Elder Wand would have been safer in Harry's Gringott's vault, left guarded and away from prying eyes (presumably) until Harry's death, at which time the magic of the Elder Wand would cease. Speaking of wands, what would Harry have done with Draco Malfoy's wand? He certainly couldn't return it to Draco or else Harry would run the risk of the Elder Wand switching allegiance back to Draco. I'll pose this question separately, though.",

        "question_body": "In the Harry Potter series, are wizards capable of creating their own spells, or are they limited to the spells that they're taught/learn? I seem to remember something about Snape creating sectumsempra , but I'm not sure if that really is the case.",
        "answer": "As @OghmaOsiris has said, spells can certainly be created, though the means of doing so is unclear. There's also quite a simple example as early as the first book: Harry vanishes a pane of glass for a few minutes, allowing a snake to escape. We can also postulate a process for spell creation from the sixth book: Harry sees several words before Sectumsempra , all of which are crossed out. It's possible that the process of spell creation involves focusing on the effect you want, discovering a word tied to it (I'm unclear as to how this would work, except that Snape obviously knew the general sound of the word), and refining it until you find the most effective word. This is borne out somewhat by the early books: casting the spell Wingardium Leviosa , slightly improper pronunciations (and slightly incorrect wand movements) still produce something like the intended effect. The other problem is wand movements -- there must be some form of standard movements, which can be used to cast most spells. There must also be a form of notation for wand movements for when the standard ones aren't correct. We can assume that Snape's Sectumsempra spell used the standard movements (possibly the standard 'attack spell' movements).",

        "question": "Why aren't Muggles extinct?",
        "question_body": "One of the basic premises of the Potterverse is that Muggles are much, much more common than wizards. This is what in part necessitates the need for the Wizarding world to hide itself away because, despite their superior powers, they would be overwhelmed by the far more massive Muggle population should conflict break out. However, we also know that wizards and witches have been around a long time . In Prisoner of Azkaban , Hermione's letter mentions: I bet he’s learning loads, I’m really jealous – the ancient Egyptian wizards were fascinating. Given that in one of Ron's letters, the Pyramids were mentioned as magical locations, this means that while we don't have a definitive date of when wizardry entered the world, we can definitively say that wizards and witches have been around since at least 2500 B.C. Most likely they have been around much longer than that. I could not find any evidence that suggests that magical people reproduce any faster or slower than a Muggle. Furthermore, being born to magical parents almost always means the child will also be magical (Squibs are considered very rare). While I don't have statistical evidence, it seems that merely having only one magical parent is enough to make it likely that the child will have magical abilities - based on Severus Snape, Seamus Finnigan, and of course, Tom Marvolo Riddle. Finally, there are of course Muggle-Borns, which while they are certainly very rare as a percentage of the Muggle population, they seem quite common enough at Hogwarts. Finally, it's fairly easy to make the argument that Wizards are more powerful than Muggles in ancient times, given the lack of Muggle technology. In the modern era, there are arguments that Muggle weapons have exceeded Wizarding power, though there is not total consensus on this. It would be hard to argue, however, that Muggles had superior power (via technology) than Wizards prior to the 20th century. In summary: Magical people have been around for at least 4500 years, probably longer. Magical people reproduce at roughly the same rate as Muggles. For most of history, magical people have had superior power to Muggles. The question: Given these reasons, why is is it that the Wizarding population does not dominate the human population via natural selection ? In-universe answer only, please. I'm not looking for a \"J.K. Rowling is bad at maths\" kind of answer.",
        "answer": "We don't need to argue about reproductive fitness to explain this. Here in the real world, the fertility rate falls off as the standard of living increases. Until quite recently, the magical community has had a much higher standard of living than Muggles. (Arguably, they still do!) So we would expect their fertility rate, historically, to be similar to our modern rate. The current British fertility rate is 1.87 births per woman. It was about 2.9 births per woman at one point in the 1960s; it was probably higher still earlier on, but let's take that as a reasonable number for Muggle fertility, and the current number as a proxy for Magical fertility. (It seems reasonable, perhaps even a little too high, based on what we know from the books.) Suppose that on average one in every two magical people marry Muggles; that seems like a slightly high estimate to me, but let's go with it for now. That would increase the number of couples in the magical community by 50%, e.g., if the birth rate was exactly 2 the effective birth rate would be 3: That makes the effective birth rate about 2.8, nearly but not quite keeping up with the nominal Muggle rate of 2.9. Obviously this all depends on what numbers you choose. But it is plausible. Addendum: As PlasmaHH and Adam point out in the comments, fertility rate isn't really the best statistic to be using here, because it doesn't take into account the number of people dying before reaching reproductive age. However, I don't think this makes my argument implausible, just slightly more subtle: you have to take into consideration that fertility may be affected by both mortality rates and standard of living. (In particular, I don't believe the mortality rate for children has changed enough since 1960 to explain more than a fraction of the drop in the fertility rate over the same period, so those figures are probably still good enough to establish plausibility.) The effect of mortality rates on fertility can be expected to cancel itself out, leaving only the standard-of-living effect as relevant. It seems reasonable to suppose that the adjusted fertility rates (counting only children who survive to reproduce) might remain different enough to counteract the growth rate of the magical community due to Wizard-Muggle marriages.

        "question_body": "Throughout the Harry Potter novels, Rubeus Hagrid is the only character consistently addressed by his last name in a friendly manner. While the trio do frequently address their enemies by their last names, and constantly refer to their professors by last name, they always address their friends by first name. Harry never calls Ron \"Weasley\", Neville never calls Hermione \"Granger\", etc. Even among the staff, most often they address each other directly by first name. McGonagall calls Dumbledore \"Albus\", Dumbledore calls Snape \"Severus\", etc. And yet everyone - staff, student, enemy, or friend - consistently addresses Rubeus Hagrid as simply \"Hagrid\". Is there any reason for that? Why the change in style of address for this one man alone?",

An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts – yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.’ Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Presumably those that do know him from school call him Hagrid because it's quite common at boarding schools to refer to someone by their surname , hence why Draco and Harry continually refer to each other as Malfoy and Potter or why Wood's friends call him Wood. Since he's ended up living at the school, pretty much everyone he knows neatly falls into one of those two categories. You may also wish to note that the sole person we see who doesn't fall into either category (e.g. someone who knew him before he went to school) refers to him by his first name first. ‘Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again … Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?’ ‘It was, sir, yes,’ said Hagrid. ‘Good wand, that one.

        "question": "Did Dumbledore consider the implications of leaving a baby on a doorstep overnight?",
        "question_body": "Albus Dumbledore famously decided to leave Harry with his Muggle relatives. He left Harry on the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive with a letter rather than giving him to the Dursleys in person, probably to minimise the risk that the Dursleys would say they don't want him. However, this process involved Harry lying on the doorstep overnight , for several long hours, before being discovered. Harry Potter rolled over inside the blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles... (Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 1, The Boy Who Lived) . Harry was out there as a one year-old baby for the whole damn night. Lily and James died on 31st October (Halloween) so Harry was deposited on the night of 1st November, when weather and overnight temperatures can be inclement, to say the least. It was a night when conditions were known to be poor. \"But I can promise a wet night tonight.\" (Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 1, The Boy Who Lived) . Dumbledore dumps the kid on the doorstep with his characteristic thoughtfulness and compassion. \"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone. (Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 1, The Boy Who Lived) . Good one, Dumbledore. Did Dumbledore give any consideration to the risk of hypothermia since it was bound to be hours before Harry was discovered? Is there any evidence that magic or something else was used to keep Harry warm? Related: Why did Dumbledore leave Harry on the Dursleys' doorstep?",
        "answer": "We know that Dumbledore is capable of casting a charm that dries (older) Harry's clothes and keeps them warm and dry for a considerable period. Presumably he's perfectly capable of casting that spell and maintaining it on a baby in a basket. Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack. ‘You’ve d-done it!’ said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked round. ‘Harry, I’m so sorry, I forgot,’ he said; he pointed his wand at Harry and at once Harry’s clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX — The Cave Don't forget, Dumbledore has big plans for Harry, keeping him alive until he can use him as a human sacrifice in his four-dimensional spat with his former pupil. so he's hardly likely to allow him to die on a doorstep through mindless neglect",

        "question_body": "In the beginning of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , Harry meets Professor Quirrell in The Leaky Cauldron for the first time, and the two shake hands with no problem: A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. ‘Professor Quirrell!’ said Hagrid. ‘Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.’ ‘P-P-Potter,’ stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, ‘c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.’ Philosopher's Stone - page 55 - Bloomsbury - chapter 5, Diagon Alley And, as we know, by the end of Philosopher's Stone , Harry's touch is enough to kill Quirrell. Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face – ‘AAAARGH!’ Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain – his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him doing a curse.

Quirrell spent the 1991-1992 school year – Harry’s first at Hogwarts – working on an attempt to steal the Philosopher’s Stone, and thus bring Voldemort back to life. His first attempt to steal it, from Gringotts, was thwarted when Hagrid took it from the vault first (PS8) and it was after this that Voldemort decided to possess him (PS17). As Voldemort’s face was sticking out the back of his head, Quirrell had to wear a purple turban the entire school year to hide him (PS7). -- from the HP Lexicon Harry met Quirrell on his birthday, before the break in: \"...that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!\" Quirrell tells Harry about his failure to steal the stone, and that that was when Voldemort decided to keep a closer watch: \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts , he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me ....\"",

That is essential.’ Deathly Hallows - page 551 - UK Hardcover - chapter 33, The Prince's Tale Dumbledore tells Snape it is 'essential' that Voldemort be the one to kill Harry, I'm assuming in order for the piece of Voldemort's soul in Harry to be properly killed as well. But why? Hermione destroyed the Hufflepuff cup; Ron destroyed the Slytherin locket; Neville killed Nagini; Harry destroyed the diadem and Tom Riddle's diary. So the Horcruxes were not immune to destruction at the hand of someone other than Voldemort.

        "answer": "As was discussed previously on SFF , Harry's blood protection initiated by his mother's sacrifice seems to ONLY work against Voldemort, not against other people. In other words, Harry, if killed by someone other than Voldemort, would die 100%, despite Voldemort having taken his blood into the new body. Therefore, it's quite possible that the \"essential\" comment was meant in the angle of Harry surviving and NOT Voldemort losing the last \"Horcrux\".",

        "answer": "This question goes to a more fundamental aspect of the nature of combat. In combat, even doing the wrong thing immediately is of more use than doing the correct thing too slowly. Statistics about gun fights show that even at distances as close as 10 feet, more than half of all shots miss. We have to presume, then, that there is something about the nature of a fast paced free-for-all such as what happened at the ministry that caused the use of such spells, rather than Avada Kedavra. The most reasonable theory is that most wizards in these kinds of situations have one or more \"go-to\" spells that they instinctively use. Harry, as we know from the escape sequence in the beginning of The Deathly Hallows, is known for his signature use of Expelliarmus. Presumably, the idea with such spells is to survive and incapacitate your opponent so that you can properly deal with them later.",

        "question": "Why was Sirius ever convicted?",
        "question_body": "Sirius himself says at some point in Goblet of Fire that Crouch pushed through legislation to have him convicted and thrown in Azkaban without a trial. There seems to be a general consensus, specifically voiced by Fudge but also implicit in Crouch pushing through this legislation, that Sirius was considered one of Voldemort’s innermost, most dangerous, and most trusted right hands. Easily as inner-circle as the Lestranges, for example. It seems quite unlikely to me that someone so close to Voldemort should not be a Death Eater—apart from Fenrir Greyback (who I would think is much less inner-circle), I do not recall hearing of any of Voldemort’s important servants not being Death Eaters. As far as canon describes, all Death Eaters have the Dark Mark magic-tattooed on their arm, to be used as a way for Voldemort to summon them to him. Considering that Karkaroff, who had definitely burnt all his Death Eater bridges, still had the Dark Mark, I am assuming that getting rid of the Mark is not possible: once it’s on, it stays on. Yet, as Hermione points out in Order of the Phoenix (ch. 16, “In the Hog’s Head”), Sirius does not have the Dark Mark . So why was he so swiftly convicted and locked up? I mean, I know they were eager to be seen to be doing something (as Fudge keeps pointing out is his excuse for most of the miscarriages of justice he commits)… but seriously, did no one think to check if Sirius actually had a Dark Mark on his arm or not? Did the Ministry of Magic not even know at the time that all Death Eaters had the Mark? Or were they just happy to accept—without the scrutiny of a full trial—that a non-Death Eater would commit mass murder for a Voldemort who was presumed defeated?",
        "answer": "I suspect that much of the rumours about Sirius (he's the worst of the worst, Voldemort's inner circle, etc.) spread after he was convicted, and that, like you said, they were eager to be seen to be doing something. You don't need the Dark Mark to betray people to Voldemort. As far as we know, Pettigrew didn't have the Dark Mark until after he'd betrayed the Potters. The Ministry might have assumed that Sirius was an \"aspiring Death Eater\" - working towards helping Voldemort as much as he could have. He wasn't imprisoned for being part of Voldemort's inner circle or being a Death Eater - he was imprisoned for (a) betraying the Potters, and (b) killing twelve people. These actions could both have been viewed as trying to get close to Voldemort, even if he had not been accepted. As Dumbledore said, Sirius did not act like an innocent man. At the scene of the twelve murders, he laughs maniacally. I don't believe it's ever explicitly said that he defends his innocence (the implication is that he's too gobsmacked at Pettigrew's weaseling). This kind of action would elevate Sirius' status - from someone who wants to be part of Voldemort's inner circle, to sociopath levels of killing, as far as the Ministry is concerned. Then, as rumours fly around and everyone gets the wrong end of the stick, it's easy to go from \"Friend of the Potters\", to \"Betrayed the Potters\", through \"Murder of innocents while laughing\" to \"I heard he was Voldemort's most ruthless supporter\". So, in conclusion, I would guess that: So why was he so swiftly convicted and locked up? I mean, I know they were eager to be seen to be doing something (as Fudge keeps pointing out is his excuse for most of the miscarriages of justice he commits)… but seriously, did no one think to check if Sirius actually had a Dark Mark on his arm or not? They were keen to be seen to be doing something; and were probably aware that Sirius was not a full Death Eater. Did the Ministry of Magic not even know at the time that all Death Eaters had the Mark? Or were they just happy to accept—without the scrutiny of a full trial—that a non-Death Eater would commit mass murder for a Voldemort who was presumed defeated? They were happy to accept that a non-Death Eater would commit mass murder - but not necessarily for Voldemort's sake. Remember the circumstances of the twelve murders (from the Ministry's perspective) - they were not carefully planned assassinations of important Order members, designed to bring Voldemort to power. It was about Black - it was poor, innocent Peter who had confronted Black, and the rest were collateral damage. The Ministry didn't view this as mass murder for a defeated Voldemort - I suspect they viewed the betrayal of the Potters as attempts to impress the Dark Lord, while the mass murder (and ensued laughing) was evidence that he was crazy, deranged and bent on vengeance and destruction, and should not be allowed on the streets. Thus, he was thrown in jail, partly to appease the public that they'd found the person responsible for the Potters' deaths, and partly because he was genuinely viewed as a danger to the public - his actions seemed excessive and unpredictable, unlike say the Malfoys, who never seemed to do anything if it didn't help them in some way.",

        "answer": "Dumbledore was very clear that Voldemort's fear of death and attempted mastery over it was the primary root of his evil. Harry didn't have any ambition to become the Master-of-death. The point was made clear in the book when Harry chose to continue the search for Horcruxes (Horcruxi?), over searching for the Hallows. The movie attempts to make the same point when Harry breaks the Elder Wand.

        "question": "Why didn't the Order of the Phoenix assist in hunting Horcruxes?",
        "question_body": "Why didn't the Order of the Phoenix assist with the trio (i.e. Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger) in the Horcrux hunt?",
        "answer": "The reason that the Order did not assist in hunting horcruxes is that the Order did not know anything about it. Dumbledore never told anyone besides Harry, and he gave Harry strict orders to not tell anyone besides Ron and Hermione. At the end of Half-Blood Prince Harry has the following conversation with McGonagall: After glancing once at this portrait, Professor McGonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself, then rounded the desk to look at Harry, her face taut and lined. “Harry,” she said, “I would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school.” “I can’t tell you that, Professor,” said Harry. He had expected the question and had his answer ready. It had been here, in this very room, that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione. “Harry, it might be important,” said Professor McGonagall. “It is,” said Harry, “very, but he didn’t want me to tell anyone.” Professor McGonagall glared at him. “Potter” — Harry registered the renewed use of his surname — “in the light of Professor Dumbledore’s death, I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat — “I don’t think so,” said Harry, shrugging. “Professor Dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died.” Here we see that McGonagall tried to get involved but Harry refused to tell her because Dumbledore did not want her, or anyone else, to know what they were doing. Of course this simply leads to the question of why Dumbledore didn't want anyone else to know about the horcruxes. The answer to this seems to be that Dumbledore felt that every additional person who knew about horcruxes was another possible weakness. He wanted as few people to know as possible lest Voldemort find out what they were up to. From the conversation in Half-Blood Prince where Dumbledore tells Harry that he can only tell Ron and Hermione: He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he turned back again. “Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you’ve told me?” Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, “Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort’s secrets.” “No, sir, I’ll make sure it’s just Ron and Hermione. Good night.” One can of course question whether this was a wise decision on Dumbledore's part, and indeed it is possible that this was one of his few mistakes. But Harry staunchly followed his orders regardless. A final question may be why couldn't the Order help them in general without being told the specifics of what they were doing. This is in fact addressed in a conversation with Lupin when he visits them at Grimmauld Place in Deathly Hallows : Lupin hesitated. “I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.” “He did,” Harry replied, “and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they’re coming with me.” “Can you confide in me what the mission is?” Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer. “I can’t, Remus, I’m sorry. If Dumbledore didn’t tell you I don’t think I can.” “I thought you’d say that,” said Lupin, looking disappointed. “But I might still be of some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.” Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine. Apparently, Harry felt that it would be impossible to include the Order in their quest without the Order members finding out what they were doing. As that would have been unacceptable, they had to decline all help whatsoever. An additional point, which Harry didn't realize until the very end, is that Dumbledore didn't want to waste anyone else's lives. As a major part of the plot was that Harry would have to die in order for Voldemort to be defeated, Dumbledore figured that he need only have Harry go after horcruxes because Harry was destined to die anyway: Dumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger plan; Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that now. He had never questioned his own assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort. Notably, Harry did end up telling one other person. On his way to give himself up to Voldemort, Harry bumped into Neville and decided that there should always be three people in the know. Since he was about to die he made Neville his replacement and told him that Voldemort's snake needed to be killed in order for Voldemort to be defeated. (He did not go into detail about horcruxes because at that point the snake was the only one left. All Neville needed to know was that the snake needed to be killed.): “Harry!” Neville looked suddenly scared. “Harry, you’re not thinking of handing yourself over?” “No,” Harry lied easily. “ ’Course not ... this is something else. But I might be out of sight for a while. You know Voldemort’s snake, Neville? He’s got a huge snake. ... Calls it Nagini ...” “I’ve heard, yeah. ... What about it?” “It’s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they — ” The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it impossible to keep talking. But he pulled himself together again: This was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville would take Harry’s place: There would still be three in the secret. “Just in case they’re — busy — and you get the chance — ” “Kill the snake?” “Kill the snake,” Harry repeated.",

Why do so in his office, where students or other teachers might come looking for him? Does he not have private sleeping quarters? As I thought about that, I realized that I wasn't sure I could recall any time where we see a teacher's living quarters in the books. (I might just be forgetting.) Is there some kind of teachers' dormitory, and that's why Lupin uses his office for that purpose? Do we ever see where any of the teachers live?",
        "answer": "The professor's offices are actually small suites of rooms. In chapter 18 of The Half Blood Prince, Harry goes looking for Slughorn early in the morning. Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing-gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed.",

        "question": "Why Did Gringotts Pay Out for Harry's Firebolt?",
        "question_body": "In Prisoner of Azkaban , Sirius Black anonymously sends Harry a Firebolt broom after the demise of Harry's Nimbus 2000 in the Whomping Willow. At the end of PoA , Sirius writes Harry a letter and explains that, yes, it was he who sent the Firebolt: There is something I never got round to telling you during our brief meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt – Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name but told them to take the gold from Gringotts vault number seven hundred and eleven – my own. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays’ worth of presents from your godfather. Prisoner of Azkaban - page 315 - Bloomsbury - chapter 22, Owl Post Again Throughout the entire series it's made very obvious that breaching Gringotts' security was punishable by death. Gringotts had tons of security measures in place (and for the sake of this question, I'm not talking about the successful break-in the trio pulled off in Deathly Hallows ). Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. ‘Stand back,’ said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. ‘If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,’ said Griphook. ‘How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?’ Harry asked. ‘About once every ten years,’ said Griphook, with a rather nasty grin. Philosopher's Stone - page 59 - Bloomsbury - chapter 5, Diagon Alley Why did the Gringotts goblins act on Sirius's written direction that the money for the Firebolt should be taken out of his vault instead of Harry's? Sirius was the most wanted wizard in Britain at the time and it would seem that the goblins wouldn't have followed such suspicious directions so blithely when they received the request for funds from, presumably, Quality Quidditch Supplies for the broom. Why wasn't the Ministry notified that a request for funds from Sirius Black's vault had been made? How is it possible that Sirius was able to purchase Harry's broom via third party? Why did Gringotts pay out? ★ I'm looking for a canon-based answer (the Harry Potter novels and three supplemental books, any J.K. Rowling interviews with relevant information, or Pottermore). I do not prefer an answer from the HP Wikia/Wikipedia.",
        "answer": "In Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows, Chapter 15, The Goblin's Revenge, when Ted Tonks asks Griphook why was he on the run, Griphook answers: \"What about you, Griphook?\" \"Similar reasons,\" said the higher-voiced goblin. \"Gringotts is no longer under sole control of my race. I recognize no master.\" According to this paragraph I assume that the Goblins of Gringotts are not subjected or held liable by Wizarding law. So they are by no means compelled to share the knowledge about Sirius to any third party including the Ministry of Magic. Furthermore the same could be said about the Lestrange vault. The Lestrange family are notorious Death Eaters imprisoned in Azkaban for life but the content of their vault remains untouched while they served in Azkaban whereas the Ministry could have confiscated it if they had any power over Gringotts.",

According to the timelines, Newt was expelled from Hogwarts long before Harry was even born, wasn't he? Harry Potter: The Prisoner of Azkaban .",
        "answer": "There are few theories for the visit and none of these are mine. Theory 1: Visiting Dumbledore The theory that makes the most sense is that Newt was visiting Dumbledore. People who have seen Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in theaters will know that Dumbledore was Newt's teacher at Hogwarts. When Newt was expelled from Hogwarts, Dumbledore strongly opposed and fought against the decision, suggesting that there's some sort of kinship between them. Dumbledore also writes the forward [sic] to Newt's book, so maybe Newt's visit was in regard to that. Theory 2: Saving Buckbeak Another theory only gets stronger once you consider one of the key events of Prisoner of Azkaban : the execution of Buckbeak the hippogriff. It doesn't take a stretch of the imagination to think that Newt would take a special interest in Buckbeak. Newt is a lover of all animals, and Buckbeak's unfair sentence to death would draw his attention. This only makes more sense considering that Newt's mother was a breeder of hippogriffs; Newt had an early love of magical creatures. He could have been there to try and stop the execution, but he was unsuccessful.

        "question_body": "If I was going to play a game of chess where I had to take the place of one of the pieces, the logical choice would be the one piece that must be protected at all costs: the king. By having Ron, Harry and Hermione all take the place of non-king pieces, Ron makes it so that he effectively has 4 kings on the board; 4 pieces that must not be allowed to fall. If he had swapped someone with the king instead, he would only have had 3 critical pieces to protect. Why didn't Ron have someone take the king's place? Why didn't Harry or Hermione object? Has JK ever commented on why it was written this way?",
        "answer": "There's not much to go on, but here's Ron's initial assessment of the task: \"It's obvious, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"We've got to play our way across the room .\" Behind the white pieces they could see another door. \"How?\" said Hermione nervously. \"I think, \" said Ron, \"we're going to have to be chessmen.\" (Emphasis mine.) A possible interpretation of this was that Ron's initial plan was to simply move from one side of the board to the other. Once they got past the white pieces, they could step off the board and get to the door. Since the king can only move one space at a time (and the queen is too important to not use against the white pieces), Ron picks middle-of-the-road pieces to replace, pieces he thinks he can get over to the door. Later, due to the white team's successes, it seems that the plan changes, and Ron realizes the only way they're going to get through is to take out the king. There was no alternative. Keep in mind also that they're racing against the clock, and Ron is an eleven-year-old boy unused to the stresses of facing deadly chessmen in the pursuit of a dark wizard. So maybe he made a lapse of judgement, or didn't think his plan all the way through. As for why Harry and Hermione didn't object: \"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are any good at chess--\" \"We're not offended\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\" They trust that Ron knows what he's doing. And at the end of the day, he does get them through the door.",

        "question": "Why was the identity of the Half-Blood Prince important to the story?",
        "question_body": "Severus Snape was half-blood (as his father was a Muggle). He referred to himself as the Half-Blood Prince. The entire plot of the sixth year revolves around the Half-Blood Prince. My question is: why was this relevant to the plot?",
        "answer": "Long-winded analysis follows arguing the toss, but there is one way in which it is very important. The fact that Snape was the Half-Blood Prince enables him to identify that Harry cursed Malfoy with Sectumsempra. Hence he asks about Harry's Potions book and bids Harry to bring him his books. This is what causes Harry to hide his copy in the Room of Requirement. Which is how he first comes upon the Ravenclaw's Diadem Horcrux, which, of course, is how he knew where to find it in 7. Yes it is important to the story in and of itself. However: Well, it's not strictly necessary to get us from Harry surviving the Killing Curse in book 1 to Harry defeating Voldemort in book 7. However, the character of Severus Snape is one of the most important and interesting in the series (including to the plot, for he is, of course, heavily involved in Dumbledore's machinations). Obviously, in The Philosopher's Stone , you think he's the villain for most of it; then it turns out that really he was on Harry's side all along. After that, there are a number of moments where his allegiance is questioned, but the facts of The Philosopher's Stone more or less keep you, Hermione - and even Harry and Ron - satisfied. Then, in The Goblet of Fire , you learn he was a Death Eater and then, of course, comes Spinner's End - which leaves quite the question mark. I dunno about you, but I fell for it, believing him to be Voldemort's double-agent. Then he kills Dumbledore and it seems confirmed. You despise him. This of course sets us up for the final, great twist in The Prince's Tale , my all-time favourite chapter. Snape being the Half-Blood Prince has a part to play in all of this. Here you have this book the book that had taught Harry so much ... the book that had become a kind of guide and friend? Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - p.491 - Bloomsbury - Chapter 24, Sectumsempra This book that is a mine of information: Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion-Making . He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks; that sort of behaviour, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored over the book, the more he realised how much was in there, not only the handy hints and short cuts on potions that were earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins which Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, the Prince had invented himself. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - pp.223-4 - Bloomsbury - Chapter 12, Silver and Opals This book without which: I'd never have won the Felix Felicis. I'd never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - p.496 - Bloomsbury - Chapter 24, Sectumsempra And you and Harry grow very attached to it, defending it against Hermione. You're taken in, just like Harry: He broke off, looking out of the window. He could not stop himself dwelling upon Dumbledore's inexcusable trust in Snape ... but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same ... in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so much ... Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - p.594 - Bloomsbury - Chapter 30, The White Tomb This adds to your sense of betrayal, it contributes to your feelings about Snape, it is all part of the backstory of Snape, with its many twists and turns, which all contribute to the power and clarity of one of the great secrets of Harry Potter. Hated Snape, Dumbledore's murderer, being perhaps the bravest man, sacrificing himself, working for Dumbledore all along. And why? For his one great love. I think it matters, I think it matters that we learn that our friend the Half-Blood Prince was the man we now despise, Severus Snape, at the end of book 6. But, more than that, it's also a nice little look at trust, we get taken for a bit of a ride, or seem to anyway. And, at the end of 6, it has the purpose hinted at above of excusing Dumbledore's trust. We might be too tempted to wonder how the great man could have been hoodwinked by Snape, had we not ourselves been. But, in some ways, this is overanalysing. Why shouldn't it be simply character development? Simply the development of one of the most crucial, controversial, and courageous characters in the series? I mean what's special about Harry Potter? It's Hogwarts, and Quidditch, and the House Cup, and Honeydukes sweet shop, and Potions, and Transfiguration, and Charms, and dinner in the Great Hall, and Gryffindor Tower. It's the everyday stuff, it's the relationships you build, over literally thousands of pages, with these characters that make you feel so thoroughly immersed in the world. That make rereading the books like seeing old friends. Strictly speaking almost none of that really advances the plot, but I couldn't be without it. And finally, it's strange. The Half-Blood Prince's book is pivotal to the story. It's how Harry gets Felix Felicis, which is how he gets the memory from Slughorn. It's also how he learns about bezoars and it's a great bit of magic for us. But the title doesn't just refer to the book. There's a double-meaning. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince isn't just about Advanced Potion-Making , it's about Harry Potter and Severus Snape. Snape is obviously a huge part of this book, killing Dumbledore. We spend the whole plot wondering about him and Malfoy and what they're up to and whether Snape really is a Death Eater, and who Malfoy's trying to kill and so on and so forth. The fact that Snape = The Half-Blood Prince, however, is not a major detail as far as pure plot advancement really goes. And yet the premise of your question seems to be that it is important to the story, but you seem to want us to tell you why :P I mean, you decide how important you think it is.",

Hagrid grunted. ‘I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,’ he said. The Dursleys hated Harry, yet oddly refused to ship him off to Hogwarts, where they could have been free from Harry's presence for a full nine months per school year. I would have thought the Dursleys would have been more reluctant to send Diddy Diddy Duddykins off to Smeltings than they would be with kicking Harry to the curb for any reason that wouldn't make the neighbors talk (\"Harry? Why, he's off to Smeltings with Dudley -- oh, yes, the boys are having a marvelous year!\" etc.). I know Uncle Vernon had promised to stomp the magic out of Harry, but are there any other canon-based reasons the Dursleys would so vehemently reject Hogwarts in lieu of having to put up with him 24-7, 365 days per year for more than seven years from the time the books began? The Dursleys are not characters I have studied in depth -- they're so awful! -- so their motivation for both hating Harry and refusing to arrange it so he'd be far away from them doesn't make sense to me. So, why didn't the Dursleys gladly ship Harry off to Hogwarts?",
        "answer": "I can think of many reasons. Chamber of Secrets reveals (well, technically the very end of Philosopher's Stone reveals) that the Dursleys are unaware that you aren't allowed to do magic outside of Hogwarts at Harry's age. So as far as they're concerned, the boy they abused for 11 years is going to stay in their house for three months out of the year with the ability to torment them. The Dursleys are shown to be absolutely obsessed with normalcy and with what their neighbors think of them. They live in constant fear that the neighbors will discover that Harry is magic, which of course would be exacerbated by him actually learning magic. They really, really hate magic. Like, a lot. They really, really hate Harry. When he asks permission to go the Quidditich World Cup, the narration describes that Uncle Dursley is torn. He'd really like Harry out of his hair for a month... but it would also have the side effect of making Harry happy. For Petunia, I think it's a straightforward case of jealousy. She always wanted to be a witch and go to Hogwarts, and she simply despises Lily and Harry and Severus for being able to go while she can't.",

        "question": "Why was Hermione always late when she used the Time Turner?",
        "question_body": "There are multiple scenes in the PoA movie where Harry and Ron are startled by Hermione \"appearing from nowhere\" to chime in during a lesson. They would ask her where she came from, and she never gave an honest answer. It is later explained that she was able to do this by using her Time Turner. My question is, why did she always only go back far enough to join in the middle of a lecture? Why not give herself enough time to get to the door when the classes started, or even to walk with Ron and Harry? Is there any reason why Hermione chose to always be late while time traveling?",
        "answer": "The Time-Turner only allows you to travel back by multiples of 60 minutes. The smallest unit of time that you can go back by using the Time-Turner is one hour. The next option after that is two hours. The Time-Turners have no capability to travel by units of time which are smaller than one hour. Time travel is done in multiples of one whole hour. That's just the way it works. So, for instance, using three turns... \"I am going to lock you in. It is -\" he consulted his watch, \"five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.\" (Prisoner of Azkaban, Chapter 21, Hermione's Secret) . ...takes you back exactly three hours... \"We've gone back in time,\" Hermione whispered, lifting the chain off Harry's neck in the darkness. \" Three hours back... \" (Prisoner of Azkaban, Chapter 21, Hermione's Secret) . Similarly, JK Rowling has added information on Pottermore which says that Time-Turners are powered by magic that works one [exact] hour at a time. According to Professor Saul Croaker, who has spent his entire career in the Department of Mysteries studying time-magic: \"As our investigations currently stand, the longest period that may be relived without the possibility of serious harm to the traveller or to time itself is around five hours. We have been able to encase single Hour-Reversal Charms , which are unstable and benefit from containment, in small, enchanted hour-glasses that may be worn around a witch or wizard’s neck and revolved according to the number of hours the user wishes to relive.\" ( Pottermore, \"Time-Turner\" ) . Therefore, if Hermione comes out of her lesson at 11:58 then the latest that she can travel back to is 10:58. The next-latest option is 09:58. She cannot travel back to, say, 10:45. If she were to go back to 09:58 then that would leave her with a whole hour to kill. What's the point in that? Consequently, in the books she travels back exactly one hour each time. She then has to rush to make up for the time that she spent finding a discrete place to use the Time-Turner. That's why she was always late or in a hurry. In addition, she may well have had further to travel between her lessons than Harry and Ron did - or the travel time which is factored in for other students isn't for Hermione because of her unusual timetable. All this assumes hour-long lessons, which runs contrary to the running hypothesis that Hogwarts lessons seem to last 45 minutes . However, if we assume the timetables give 45 minutes teaching time and 15 minutes for students to travel between lessons then lessons would still be spaced at hour-long intervals. Which means that the one hour that the Time-Turner gives Hermione for moving between classes is sufficient, if only just. In fairness to Hermione, she wasn't in the habit of walking into lessons halfway through. She was just often flustered and out-of-breath when she had no obvious reason to be. Movie answer The books are consistent that one turn equals one hour of time travel. Alas, the movies are less consistent and since the question cites the film I thought I'd answer in relation to that. In the film, Dumbledore still locks them in the hospital wing at midnight. On cue, the MIDNIGHT BELL begins to CHIME... DING!.. They still turn the Time-Turner three times. DUMBLEDORE: Three turns should do it, I think. Yet they end up traveling back to 19:30! HERMIONE: Seven-thirty. Where were we at seven-thirty? HARRY: Huh? Dunno...going to Hagrid's? They travel back by four-and-a-half hours. So, as far as the movies are concerned, one turn of the Time-Turner equals...one-and-a-half hours? I can only presume that that's how the film-canon works. To confuse things more, when Harry and Hermione are running back to the hospital wing the huge clock on the wall has a hand pointing to twenty-past (2:06 below) I'm assuming this is the second hand (not the minute hand or the hour hand) since it's striking for midnight. But this is also unclear. Perhaps the confusion about how the Time-Turner works in the movies is due to an attempt by the filmmakers to marry the turns of the Time-Turner (one hour) with the length of the lessons (an hour-and-a-half) - to make them the same length. This may be giving the film-makers too much credit. For whatever reason, though, one turn in the movies seems to equal 90 minutes of time travel. This would still leave Hermione with the same quandary when it comes to travelling between lessons, however. If anything, she'd be left with less time than she would in the books. If a double lesson is 90 minutes and the Time-Turner sends her back by 90 minutes then that leaves her with next to no time in which to move between classes.",

Did Voldemort actually curse the job of Defense Against Dark Arts professor after being denied the position? As in, is there a canonical/JKR proof/confirmation that it was, indeed, the actual cause from him, as opposed to a plausible conspiracy theory held by everyone in Potterverse with zero proof?",
        "answer": "Yes, the job was definitely cursed. There have been several interviews with J.K. Rowling where she states that Voldemort has jinxed the job as a point-of-fact. I don’t recall it being explicitly stated in the books (Voldemort never admits to such a curse), except for Dumbledore’s guess in Half-Blood Prince . An interview shortly after the publication of Deathly Hallows confirms that it was broken with Voldemort’s death, which only makes sense if there was a jinx to break: Do Ron or Hermione or Harry ever return to Hogwarts in any capacity? Well, I can well imagine Harry returning to give the odd talk on– on Defense Against the Dark Arts. And – I – and, of course, the jinx is broken now because Voldemort's gone . Now they can keep a good Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher from here on in. So that aspect of the – of the wizarding education is now provided for. — J.K. Rowling One-On-One: Part One with NBC (July 2007) Another interview explicitly states that the job was cursed, and also provides part of the inspiration for the curse: And Defence Against the Dark Arts was also fun because every year you had a new teacher. For the older members of the audience they will remember the Spinal Tap drummer … and … some of you do, clearly. (laughs) Well, when I planned the books I thought that every year we'll have a different Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, because the job was cursed, as you know. — J.K.

Additionally, it is in Dumbledore's best interests to create the illusion of competence he lacks. Later in the series we learn that he made some very glaring and obvious mistakes, and things work out largely through luck and factors he never anticipated... although he often takes credit for those, too. Dumbledore hadn't seen Moody regularly, maybe even not since shortly after Harry's birth. Mad-Eye is described as an \"old friend\" of Dumbledore's who \"doesn't trust anyone anymore\" and had to be cajoled and prodded to un-retire. While it's not concrete, it seems very reasonable that between Moody's paranoid retirement and Dumbledore's running a school and a sprawling power base, neither of them had much time for or interest in casually dropping by for tea. At any rate, Dumbledore had a lot on his mind (what with hosting a lethal set of competitions and two unscrupulous rival schools, as well as other pressures we only later on find out he was dealing with) at the time. Moody's paranoia seemed more justified than ever, and Dumbledore was probably just happy to have the man there--and maybe a little overconfident in his old friend's ability to keep himself safe.",

        "question": "Why didn't James' love and sacrifice for Lily protect her?",
        "question_body": "We know that Harry survived Voldemort's killing curse because Lily loved him so much that she sacrificed herself in an attempt to protect him. This resulted in a very powerful charm that pretty much rendered Harry immune to Voldemort (until Voldemort figured out the work-around). Then there's this passage describing that night: [Voldemort] was over the threshold as James came sprinting down the hall. It was easy, too easy, he had not even picked up his wand ... \"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off -\" Hold him off, without a wand in his hand! ... He laughed before casting the curse ... \"Avada Kedavra!\" Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Chapter 17: Bathilda's Secret So James Potter, fully aware that he was sacrificing himself (he said \"I'll hold him off,\" not \"I'll get rid of him\") ran to face Voldemort because of his love for Lily and Harry. This seems to be very similar to how Lily tried to protect Harry from Voldemort even though she knew she would die. It seems to me that the same charm should have been cast upon Lily when James died, but just moments later Voldemort killed her too. Apparently James' sacrifice did not result in a charm that protected Lily, even though he did it from love for her and Harry. Why is this? Was something different in the circumstances?",
        "answer": "Actually, I'll make my comment an answer. According to J.K. Rowling, the difference between James' death and Lily's is that Voldemort always intended to kill James; he gave Lily multiple chances to step aside and let Voldemort kill Harry, and she refused and died protecting Harry. That is what created the protective enchantment between Lily and Harry. Lily chose to die for Harry; James wasn't given a choice. ES: This is one of my burning questions since the third book - why did Voldemort offer Lily so many chances to live? Would he actually have let her live? JKR: Mhm. ES: Why? JKR: [silence] Can't tell you. But he did offer; you're absolutely right. Don't you want to ask me why James's death didn't protect Lily and Harry? There's your answer - you've just answered your own question - because she could have lived - and chose to die. James was going to be killed anyway. Do you see what I mean? I'm not saying James wasn't ready to; he died trying to protect his family, but he was going to be murdered anyway. He had no - he wasn't given a choice, so he rushed into it in a kind of animal way. I think there are distinctions in courage. James was immensely brave. But the caliber of Lily's bravery was, I think in this instance, higher because she could have saved herself. Now any mother, any normal mother would have done what Lily did. So in that sense, her courage too was of an animal quality but she was given time to choose. James wasn't. It's like an intruder entering your house, isn't it? You would instinctively rush them. But if in cold blood you were told, \"Get out of the way,\" you know, what would you do? I mean, I don't think any mother would stand aside from their child. But does that answer it? She did very consciously lay down her life. She had a clear choice. ES: And James didn't. JKR: Did he clearly die to try and protect Harry specifically given a clear choice? No. It's a subtle distinction and there's slightly more to it than that but that's most of the answer.

        "question": "What is Hermione Granger's ethnicity?",
        "question_body": "In all of the Potter books, there appears to be only one reference to Hermione's skin colour: They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor — Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown , both waving frantically at him. Prisoner of Azkaban, Chapter 4: The Leaky Cauldron While it would be easy to assume that JKR meant that she's tanned (e.g. from the sun), other writers have suggested that the line above, and lack of other descriptors strongly implies that Hermione is naturally dark-skinned. Zeba Blay, the 'Voices Culture Writer' for Huffington Post even goes so far as to say that it's down to individual readers to make their own judgement on the issue. \"So is the fictional character actually white? Perhaps that's a determination readers should make for themselves. \" - Italics and bolding mine Is there any evidence either way? Has JKR ever given an in-universe reason to assume that Hermione is white, black or mixed-race?",
        "answer": "Stuff and nonsense. Why would you need to remark on Hermione's \"very brown\" skin if that was its normal shade? This is very clearly saying that both Ron and Hermione have been spending more time in the sun than they usually do; in Ron, it comes out as freckles, and in Hermione, it manifests as a tan. Add in the book covers (by the time the later books, and especially the reissues, came out, JKR had enough clout to veto anything that was blatantly wrong) and the movie casting (for which we know JKR had input), and it's clear that people are trying to \"read into\" this one quote things that are definitely not there. Word of God is now on record as saying Hermione's race was not specified, but in that case, the quote in question doesn't really make sense: unless we all acquire Mr. Data's observing capabilities, we wouldn't be able to tell whether Ms. Dumezweni spent her vacation deep underground in a cave vs. on a sunny beach. I think Ms. Rowling had a white girl in mind for Hermione while writing the books -- hence the allusions to turning pink, looking pale, and resembling a panda --, but she realizes that casting a play or movie is about more than physical descriptions. Remember that the original productions of Romeo & Juliet had a boy playing Juliet.",

        "question": "How can Ron know that Voldemort was in Slytherin if nobody knows his real identity?",
        "question_body": "When Ron meets Harry on the Hogwarts Express in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , they have this conversation: “What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry. “Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.” “That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?” “Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. - Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Chapter 6 (The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters) So Ron apparently knows Voldemort was in Slytherin. But at the end of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , it is made clear that Voldemort's real identity as the brilliant (Slytherin) student Tom Riddle is unknown to most - in Dumbledore's own words: ‘Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving the school … travelled far and wide … sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognisable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.’ - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 18 (Dobby’s Reward) So how could Ron (as well as, I guess, most wizards) not know Voldemort's real identity yet know the actual House he was in at Hogwarts?",
        "answer": "The Dark Lord himself might have said he was in Slytherin. When the Dark Lord was at the height of his power, though he might not have wanted to talk much about his father or Muggle heritage, he was proud to be the descendant of Salazar Slytherin. He had been even as Tom Riddle, and though he wanted to be rid of his father’s name, he was quite proud of his relation to Slytherin. He called himself \" Lord Voldemort, heir of Salazar Slytherin \", indicating that he intended to keep the Slytherin connection even after he became Lord Voldemort. “Now, Harry, I’m going to teach you a little lesson. Let’s match the powers of Lord Voldemort, heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him.” - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 17 (The Heir of Slytherin) He carried this pride into adulthood as well. When he takes over Hogwarts many years later, he announced that there will be no more houses, only Slytherin. “There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,’ said Voldemort. ‘There will be no more houses. The emblem, shield and colours of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone, won’t they, Neville Longbottom?” - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 36 (The Flaw in the Plan) It didn’t seem like the Dark Lord was trying to keep his Hogwarts house secret. Even if he didn’t want the wizarding world knowing that he was once Tom Riddle, he was likely perfectly happy to say he was a Slytherin. Him saying it himself would explain why people seem so certain about his house, rather than it being treated like a widely believed rumor (like the circumstances of his disappearance, or Harry being thought to be the heir of Slytherin by his classmates). His claim to be the heir of Slytherin and ability to speak Parseltongue would help support the idea he was in Slytherin to anyone who knew of them, but the simplest way that people could seem to know his house is for him to have said it.",

        "question": "Were there any canon examples of Harry being an innately powerful wizard?",
        "question_body": "Was Harry Potter an innately powerful/skillful Wizard in any way, based on canon? It seems that whenever Harry Potter performed some unusually potent bit of magic (potent as far as require raw power AND/OR skill), most of the time we find that it wasn’t innately Harry’s skill, but a combination of: some extraneous magic forces/rules/powers circumstance great reaction time (which is obviously extraordinary from his Quidditch playing; and is likely a larger factor in his dueling than the strength of his magic) general smartness or (the part that Harry’s detractors, including Voldemort missed) Harry’s strength of character/personality The only two counter-examples I can think of which show him as having extraordinary or at least obviously above average magical abilities are : His skill at flying brooms - while a part of it is pure physical skill, at least part is magical. His (corporeal) Patronus charm As far as examples of his unusual feats being due to reasons listed above : Obviously, surviving Avada Kedavra as an infant - due to Lily’s sacrifice Parselmouth talent - proxied via Voldemort’s piece of soul. Ability to see the Sorcerer’s Stone in the Mirror of Erised - due to purity of his character, nothing magical. Obvious lack of talent at potion making throughout all of the books (sans cheating in HBP) His win over the Basilisk - due to Hermione’s research, character traits, and as a consequence of the last one, getting Fawkes and Gryffindor’s Sword’s help. Just to be clear, before someone flames me - what he did was obviously super extraordinary, BUT IMHO he would have achieved the same result if he was turned into a Squib for the duration of Chamber of Secrets fight. TriWizard Tournament entry - wasn’t him, it was Barty Crouch TriWizard Tournament second challenge - a combination of character and outside help (someone told him about Gillyweed) TriWizard Tournament third challenge - Mostly, Barty Crouch’s cheating Note that I’m omitting the first challenge, since that one was the aforementioned Broom flying skills. His survival in the cemetery after Voldemort’s return - again, a combination of superior strength of character and super powerful wandlore magic that had nothing to do with his skill as a Wizard. The whole “last Horcrux” thing when surviving the second Avada Kedavra from Voldemort His ownership of the Elder Wand in the very last duel with Voldemort. So, to paraphrase my original question, was there any canon/JKR evidence that Harry was anything but a completely average/mediocre wizard in any way, shape, or form if you take into account only his own magical abilities and skills?",
        "answer": "Long answer warning. :) Harry was Largely Average Approaching this subject from a broader angle than just \"Was Harry a demonstrably powerful wizard,\" one of the reasons that Harry Potter was such a successful series is because J. K. Rowling did such an excellent job at making her characters relatable. What you say is true; Harry was not a particularly excellent wizard. He was a totally normal boy, with totally normal boy problems, thrust into a very abnormal set of circumstances. Harry was neither a child prodigy, nor a complete buffoon when it came to academics. His grades were decidedly above average, but he was not without his challenges. Potions were a struggle for him; whether that is contributable to Snape's teaching style is debatable. Despite his academic struggles, his O.W.L. scores were actually fairly impressive: Astronomy: (A)cceptable Care of Magical Creatures: (E)xceeds Expectations Charms: (E)xceeds Expectations Defense Against the Dark Arts: (O)utstanding Divination: (P)oor Herbology: (E)xceeds Expectations History of Magic: (D)readful Potions: (E)xceeds Expectations Transfiguration: (E)xceeds Expectations. Harry always hated Divination, and he passed out midway through the History of Magic exam. During the practical portion of the Astronomy test, Umbridge was attempting to apprehend Hagrid. Harry was severely distracted by this, and still passed the exam. Even with Potions, which he was constantly challenged in, he still managed to Exceed Expectations. Harry's Character is What Makes Him a Hero The strength of Harry Potter lies not in his ability as a wizard, but in his character : his perseverance, his goodness, his unfailing courage, and his strong bond with his friends. These are universal to anyone reading a story; not every reader is a genius or some kind of prodigy. Those characters are there for readers to identify with, but Harry is an everyman . Harry was Very Good at Certain Things Aside from these things, Harry did show exceptional strength in the practical application of magic . Harry was capable of post N.E.W.T. level magic in his third year: a corporeal Patronus. He was an extremely accomplished duelist, having faced down Voldemort numerous times, and having defeated Draco Malfoy (who was renowned in their year as a duelist) numerous times. Harry's flying was top notch, as you mentioned, as was his affinity to deal with magical creatures (owls, thestrals, hippogriffs, a giant, centaurs, a half-blinded dragon to name a few). He was shown to be immune to the effects of the Imperius curse, demonstrating his strong will and character. Harry was shown to have aptitude in the Dark Arts as well: he could cast the Imperius Curse effectively, use all manners of jinxes and hexes, and was able to use a Dark Art spell correctly and almost lethally the first time he casted it (Sectumsempra). Harry was complemented by McGonagall in his sixth year on his Transfiguration ability; an impressive feat, considering McGonagall was widely considered to be the most powerful Transfigurer in the Wizarding World. Harry was talented at Charms, possessing a powerful and long ranged Accio. His Patronus charm was well known for its potency, as well. He was also capable of casting the protective charms Hermione used to protect their tent while traveling. Harry could also cast non-verbal spells, and was able to cast Lumos in Order of the Phoenix when his wand was a few yards from his body. In Summary While Harry was not a magical genius like Hermione or Dumbledore, he was quite gifted in the practical application of magic. Aside from that, there is nothing terribly remarkable about Harry. He is what J. K. Rowling intended him to be: an everyman foil for the plot of her book series that really anyone would be able to relate to. Relevant Addendum In researching another answer, I stumbled upon this quote from J. K. Rowling regarding Neville Longbottom, and his place in the story next to Harry's. JKR: I love Neville. I love Neville so much. Always loved Neville. And I always had big plans for Neville, you know? And he really was The Boy It Could've Been, because as you know, as I made clear, he was born hours before Harry, he was born on the 30th of July, Voldemort singled him out as the other possibility. But the great thing about Neville's story for me, the over-arching story about Neville, is that he proves himself to be a boy who could've done it too. Yeah, Harry had the scar and arguably, Harry had an edge more talent because Harry-- he has an extraordinary instinct for the right thing to do. He's just got the right instinct , and that's what would make him, in due course, a phenomenal Auror. But Neville was, I think, amazing in the final battle, and proved himself a hundred times over worthy of being a Gryffindor, his parents' son, despite the very difficult childhood he had in the hands of his very pushy grandmother, and I know, she loves him and he loves her, but she's not an easy person to be raised by. So yeah, so that for me, was the big thing about Neville. He's not on the surface-- I suppose he's not as cool when it comes right down to it, although Harry, of course, made himself cool. He was a scrawny little kid in glasses, and he comes through, and he becomes the guy everyone wants to know. J.K. Rowling's final assessment of Harry is that, yes, he was more talented than someone like Neville Longbottom, but it wasn't his talent that typically won the day for Harry. It was his instinct in combat and skill in practical magic that made Harry such a good wizard.",

At the end of Goblet of Fire , the carriages still appeared horseless to Harry: Hermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages which were now trundling towards them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised, but gratified, signed a fragment of parchment for Ron . Goblet of Fire - Page 629 - British Hardcover - Adult Edition At the beginning of Order of the Phoenix , Harry sees the Thestrals for the first time: Here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the students above first year up to the castle. Harry glanced quickly at them, turned away to keep a lookout for Ron and Hermione, then did a double-take. The coaches were no longer horseless. There were creatures standing between the carriage shafts. Order of the Phoenix - Page 178 - British Hardcover - Adult Edition We know that only those who have seen death can see Thestrals: ‘Don’ worry, it won’ hurt yeh,’ said Hagrid patiently. ‘Righ’, now, who can tell me why some o’ yeh can see ’em an’ some can’t? ’ Hermione raised her hand . ‘Go on then,’ said Hagrid, beaming at her . ‘The only people who can see Thestrals,’ she said, ‘are people who have seen death.’ ‘Tha’s exactly right,’ said Hagrid solemnly [...] Order of the Phoenix - Page 394 - British Hardcover - Adult Edition A month went by between Cedric's death and the end of the spring term -- is this enough time for Harry to have truly internalized Cedric's death? Goblet of Fire indicates that Harry was in shock following Cedric's murder, but was able to relate the story of Cedric's death to Mr. and Mrs. Diggory. When he looked back, even a month later, Harry found he had few memories of the following days. It was as though he had been through too much to take in any more. The recollections he did have were very painful. The worst, perhaps, was the meeting with the Diggorys that took place the following morning .

        "answer": "This one was answered (or one might say waved away), a long time back by JKR. She said that the death has to sink in for somebody to see the Thestrals.

JK Rowling: At the end of Goblet of Fire, we sent Harry home more depressed than he had ever been leaving Hogwarts. Now I knew that the Thestrals were coming and I can prove that because they are in the book that I produced for Comic Relief, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , these unlucky black winged horses. However, if Harry had seen them then and we hadn't explained them then, I thought that would be rather a cheat on the reader in that Harry suddenly sees these monsters but we don't go anywhere with them, so to explain to myself I said that you had to have seen the death and allowed it to sink in a little bit before slowly these creatures became solid in front of you, so that's how I am going to sneak past that one.

        "question": "Since Voldemort knew that Dumbledore did not kill Grindelwald, why did he think that killing Snape was necessary for him to wield the Elder Wand?",
        "question_body": "We know that Voldemort knew that Grindelwald was not killed by Dumbledore, as he himself killed Grindelwald. We also know that Voldemort knew that Dumbledore was the last person to wield the Elder Wand with its full allegiance because he killed Snape in an attempt to inherit that allegiance from him, who he assumed inherited it from Dumbledore. Now Voldemort is no idiot. Following this chain of logic, based off of what he knew, he must have realized that Dumbledore didn't gain the wand's allegiance through murder as he never killed Grindelwald, so why did he feel the need to kill Snape in order to win the wands allegiance for himself? Surely he must have known that disarming him would have been enough. Was he so blinded by his desire for the wand that he was willing to try anything? Or was he so pressed for time that he didn't fully consider the matter? I can't imagine the latter to be true as Voldemort himself said to Snape before killing him that he considered the matter for a long time, but that, of course, could be a lie. Or perhaps he decided that what with Snape no longer being a competent spy after being outed that he had outlived his purpose and would be more valuable dead as a result of this last ditch effort to gain the wands true power. I'm just answering my own question at this point, but I'd like to put it to you all. Is there something I am missing here? Is there any word from JKR that can clear up this seeming lapse in Voldemorts judgement?",
        "answer": "Let's take a closer look at the scene in question. Voldemort, when explaining he is going to kill Snape, says the following: \"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.\" Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , Chapter 32, The Elder Wand The first thing this quote reveals is that Voldemort, even after knowing that Dumbledore was able to take the Elder Wand from Grindlewald without killing him, was unable to put two and two together. He claims that \"The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner,\" which, as we know, isn't true. It seems that Voldemort isn't as smart as he seems. In fact, there are multiple instances where Voldemort fails to pick up the subtleties of a particular branch of magic. For example, he took Harry's blood in The Goblet of Fire without realizing the disastrous effect it would have on him: \"He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort's one last hope for himself.\" Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , Chapter 35, King's Cross And there's the fact he repeated his mistake of killing Harry's parents (which gave Harry magical protection against him) by killing Harry, which protected the students of Hogwarts from Voldemort's magic: \"You won't be killing anyone else tonight,\" said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. \"You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people...\" \"But you did not!\" \"I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you? \" Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , Chapter 36, The Flaw in the Plan The second reason has to do with Voldemort's personality. In the first quote I cited, Voldemort claims that \"the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine\" while Snape lives. I suspect that Voldemort, regardless of whether he understood the subtleties of wand-lore, would have felt like he didn't own the Elder Wand unless he killed everyone who had a claim to it. Remember, Voldemort is obsessed with killing, and sees it as the solution to all problems. As the above quote shows, he incorrectly assumed that killing Harry would lead to his victory, even though it eventually led to his downfall. To quote from a 2007 JKR interview on Pottercast : [T]he Elder Wand knows no loyalty except to strength. So it's completely unsentimental. It will only go where the power is. So if you win, then you've won the wand. So you don't need to kill with it. But, as is pointed out in the books, not least by Dumbledore because it is a wand of such immense power, almost inevitably, it attracts wizards who are prepared to kill and who will kill. And also it attracts wizards like Voldemort who confuse being prepared to murder with strength . This obsession with killing is probably why he ignored the clear evidence that it is not necessary to kill the previous owner of the elder wand to possess it. To summarize: it's a combination of ignorance (on a wide variety of magical topics) and an obsession with killing that makes Voldemort kill Snape rather than disarm him.",

In fact, I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.\" (Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 29, Careers Advice) . One of the elite wizards who made the grade was Dawlish. He excelled academically and became an Auror - but was still taken down by Dumbledore when they fought in the Headmaster's study at Hogwarts... \"Don't be silly, Dawlish,\" said Dumbledore kindly. \"I'm sure you are an excellent Auror - I seem to remember that you achieved 'Outstanding' in all your N.E.W.T.s - but if you attempt to - er - bring me in by force, I will have to hurt you.\" (Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 27, The Centaur and the Sneak) . ...and again a few months later... \"[Scrimgeour] has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasn't kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.\" (Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 17, A Sluggish Memory) . Now there's no shame in getting owned twice by Albus Dumbledore. He was probably the most powerful wizard in history. Even Lord Voldemort couldn't overpower him. Yet, by the time of Deathly Hallows , Dawlish is being defeated by far less intimidating adversaries than Albus Dumbledore. He's Confunded by the Order of the Phoenix and made to lay a false trail of information to the Death Eaters. \"Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.\" Snape was smiling. \"My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time, he is known to be susceptible.\" (Deathly Hallows, Chapter 1, The Dark Lord Ascending) . Now Dawlish is getting hoodwinked by a simple Confundus Charm. Even more embarrassingly, this situation is known to have happened before. Dawlish is starting to sound less like an elite spy, and more like a liability. Note that, at this point, Dawlish is definitely still working in the Auror's office. And that's not all. Next we hear that Dawlish has been overcome in a fight with an unarmed wizard . \"I've got to say, Dirk, I'm surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word was you'd been caught.\" \"I was,\" said Dirk. \"I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it, Stunned Dawlish and nicked his broom. It was easier than you'd think; I don't think he's quite right at the moment. Might be Confunded. If so, I'd like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably saved my life.\" (Deathly Hallows, Chapter 15, The Goblin's Revenge) . Clearly Dawlish is struggling to do his job at this point. He's still feeling the after-effects of the Confundus Charm and consequently is confused, disorientated and weak. Hardly qualities you want from a crack Auror. Here he's only delegated a very simple task: prisoner transport. This is routine work, especially for someone as intelligent and accomplished as Dawlish. Yet he is overcome by an unarmed prisoner, Stunned and left for dead at the side of the road. This is an utter humiliation. It wasn't an isolated incident, either. He also gets his butt handed to him by Neville's Gran. \"Thing was,\" he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he was grinning, \"they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn't need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,\" Neville laughed, \"Dawlish is still in St Mungo's and Gran's on the run.\" (Deathly Hallows, Chapter 29, The Lost Diadem) . Now I don't know what kind of supervision, discipline and oversight the Ministry of Magic operated in relation to their staff. But surely Dawlish should have been removed as an Auror after all his missteps? Or at least given some kind of leave of absence? He gets beaten on five separate occasions, sometimes in the most humiliating of circumstances. Where an employee is underperforming so badly over such a prolonged period of time that would seem to represent a failure to intervene on the part of the management. Dawlish was surely doing badly enough to be fired, or at least demoted or removed from active duty. Why was he permitted to remain an Auror given his woeful incompetence?",
        "answer": "JKR doesn't consider him to be incompetent : \"Dawlish had to be good. He had to be good because he became an Auror. There's no denying that. But he has his weaknesses and Dumbledore knew how to exploit them. Let's face it. Anyone, anyone going up to Dumbledore pre-trying on the Horcrux, pre-maiming his hand, anyone is gonna be in trouble going up against Dumbledore. Even Voldemort didn't want to do it. So there's no dishonor to Dawlish.\" Given the quotes in the question re: confunding and that we see Dawlish engaged in capturing Muggle-borns, it isn't unreasonable to presume that he is under the charm during the entire scope of book 7. Additionally, from the same source, JKR indicates that he is mentally and physically affected by the things that happen to him: By the time Augusta Longbottom got to him, he had been-- several people had attacked Dawlish. I mean, I think he was a bit punch-drunk by that point, you know. He had become a favorite punch-bag of the Order of the Phoenix by then. So I don't think he was firing on all cylinders. But I really saw Mrs. Longbottom as a powerful witch. So - he isn't incompetent. He is likely continually under mind control and thus there is no reason for the Death Eater Ministry regime to remove him when he is serving their purposes, and he is over-exerted to the point of being 'punch-drunk' - which in one definition is stated as \"stupefied by or as if by a series of heavy blows to the head.\"",

        "question_body": "Professor Gilderoy Lockhart was not a talented wizard. We learn this near the end of the Chamber of Secrets when it is revealed that he is a fraud. In short, Gilderoy Lockhart was a scam-artist. Before we learn that Lockhart is a talentless fraud, Harry suffers a broken arm during a game of Quidditch. Upon seeing Harry getting injured, Gilderoy runs onto the field and attempts to perform a highly difficult spell to mend Harry's broken arm, which fails in spectacular fashion. My question is: Why did Gilderoy do that? At this stage in the story it has not been revealed to the reader that he is a scam artist, but Gilderoy himself must have been aware that he is incompetent. Why would a man whose entire public image is a carefully woven tapestry of lies run onto a Quidditch field and demonstrate his incompetence in front of the entire school?",
        "answer": "Gilderoy Lockhart was an arrogant, vain, conceited, narcissistic, self-serving egomaniac. He was simply trying to show off, in the same way he tried to show off with his \"Duelling\" Club and got his behind handed to him by Snape. He may know he's a fraud, but he still thinks he's brilliant. He's also trying his best to keep up appearances as a capable DADA teacher, despite being woefully incompetent. In the Chamber of Secrets book (Emphasis Mine): “Oh, no, not you,” he moaned. “Doesn’t know what he’s saying,” said Lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. “Not to worry, Harry. I’m about to fix your arm.” “No!” said Harry. “I’ll keep it like this, thanks. . . .” ... “Lie back, Harry,” said Lockhart soothingly. “It’s a simple charm I’ve used countless times —” Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - THE ROGUE BLUDGER - 172 He's very clearly trying to announce to anyone who'll listen how great he is and how fixing Harry's arm is the simplest thing in the world for a Wizard of his caliber. He's also trying to deflect any suggestions that his boasts may be anything other than 100% accurate.",

Is there a fix for this type of spell? Did Hermione ever recover their memories and return to them after Voldemort was defeated?",
        "answer": "I'm sure she must have, but it's not talked about in the books. It wasn't a big plot point in the books, it was just mentioned in passing, although in the movie, they made a bigger point of it, likely for the high emotional feeling during the scene. Hermione cared very much about her parents. She had to obliviate them because she didn't want them to get killed during the war, and made them want to move to Australia and have new identities instead of being Grangers. She was powerful enough to reverse any charm she put on them. No doubt it took her a while to find them after the events of the book, but I bet it was near the top of the list of things for her to do. In fact, in Chapter 6, she says the following: I’ll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don’t—well, I think I’ve cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy.

        "question": "Why did \"Moody\" suggest to Harry that he should consider becoming an Auror?",
        "question_body": "\"Moody\" (Barty Crouch Jr) suggests this to Harry after he is almost caught out of bed in the middle of the night. \"You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?\" \"No,\" said Harry, taken aback. \"You want to consider it,\" said Moody, nodding and looking at Harry thoughtfully. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter-25, The Egg and the Eye Considering the events of the night, Harry was completely fooled by fake Moody. Harry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought about Snape, and Crouch, and what it all meant....Why was Crouch pretending to be ill, if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to? What did he think Snape was concealing in his office? Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter-25, The Egg and the Eye Did \"Moody\"(Crouch Jr) suggest it only to lead Harry to believe that he was thinking along the right lines, and thereby throw him off scent from discovering his (fake Moody's) true identity? Or was it a genuine suggestion, based on a full term of teaching Harry DADA? The latter doesn't seem likely considering Barty Crouch Jr was plotting Harry's death by the end of the year. But he could have just been doing his undercover job to perfection. In either case, Harry does go on to reflect how ironic it was that it was a Death Eater in disguise that first put this idea in him. My question is, was it an actual observation based on Harry's abilities (ignoring the murder plan), or was it a clever defense mechanism, by way of flattery, by the Death Eater to keep his identity concealed , considering his actual name had just been seen on the Marauder's Map?",
        "answer": "First of all, Barty was Harry's teacher and he certainly recognised that Harry had the aptitude for the job: the boy was good with DADA spells, had a strong will - he even succeeded to resist the Imperius curse put on him by Barty himself. It was also evident that Harry had courage, performed extremely well under pressure, had good reflexes and a quick response. In addition Harry had, as Hermione put it 'a saving people thing'. All those qualities made Harry a logical candidate for being an auror, something that the real Moody, (who was an excellent auror with vast experience and also a veteran who trained young aurors) would have certainly recognised. All that Barty did was is staying in character - he indeed did an excellent job at playing the role of Alastair Moody. Barty probably thought that it is exactly what the real Moody would have done: Prepare the students and especially Harry for the battles to come, teach constant vigilance and identify the Unforgivables, even how to resist the Imperius curse (!) and recommend his profession to those who showed capabilities for it. Barty did all this to maintain his cover under the watchful eyes of Dumbledore. Also, maybe having an above average intelligence and succeeding in fooling everyone at Hogwarts made Barty somewhat overconfident and he probably concluded that it wouldn't matter in the end - Harry wouldn't live long enough to use all the acquired knowledge, as he, Barty, the Dark Lord's most loyal follower will use his considerable talents to hand him over to his master, so the boy won't be able to grow up, became an auror and cause any real trouble to Voldemort and his followers. What makes Barty such an intriguing character that the advice he gives is usually on the point - he boosted Neville's confidence praising his herbology skills, in a really tactful way, and did the same with Harry. Empty flattery wouldn't have achieved the same results. Barty seems to have really excellent people skills, as opposed to Moody who is a bit dry and uninspiring. It seems that Barty, regardless of his objectives and blasé attitude towards torture and murder made a better job at being Moody than the original.",

        "question": "What are the rules and limits of Accio spell?",
        "question_body": "We know that Accio spell (aka Summoning Charm ) has some limits: It can be blocked (e.g. Harry couldn't Accio the Diadem in RoR in Deathly Hallows). Many more failures are listed on Wikia. But what are the exact full rules and limitations governing the spell in Harry Potter world? Distance? Line-of-sight? Knowing exact or approximate location? Specificity of item (e.g. \"Accio Broom\" seemed to work for Weasleys in OotP to bring their locked-up brooms - why not just a random broom?) Types of Accio-able stuff? Can you Accio water? Lump of earth? Gases/liquids/etc...? Can you Accio based on jQuery selector (or an SQL where clause), for lack of a better description? E.g. \"Accio the book that has the word 'Flamel'\"? \"Accio biggest green ball from this room\"? Can you Accio ALL items of a kind? (the reason I thought of this whole question was seeing \"Accio all guns\" comment in this Q&A ). Can you Accio vague stuff? (\"Accio meal\"). Other rules that can be inferred. NOTE: While Wikia article has some of the info, it is clearly very lacking in details on specific rules based on specific instances in canon. I'm looking for a fully comprehensive, organized ruleset for the charm, not merely 1-2 tidbits in Wikia article.",
        "answer": "TL;DR: As long as you know exactly what you want, verbalizing the precise name isn't necessary (up to and incluing omitting the subject at all). Ref: GoF, Harry vs. dictionary; GoF, Mrs.Weasley vs WWW products No line of sight needed. Ref: OotP, twins vs broomstics. No need to know the location Ref: HP, Hermione vs Horcrux books. No known distance limits (depends on concentration), Hogwarts to grounds is OK Ref: GoF, Harry vs broom SQL query where clause: possible Ref: DH, Hermione vs Horcrux books. Specificity of Item: With Accio, you don't always need to know what it is you're summoning, apparently. I mentioned in my answer regarding Hermione and Accio that the first instance of Accio that I could find is Mrs Weasley stripping the twins of their WWW products (in this case, ton-tongue toffees). She doesn't specify what she's Accio -ing but just says \" Accio ! Accio ! Accio !\" and confiscates the twins' items. ( Goblet of Fire - The Portkey ) Also in Goblet of Fire , Hermione and Harry demonstrate that one doesn't have to exactly name the item being summoned. ‘Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell,’ Harry said, throwing a Rune Dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again, ‘threaten me with a dragon. Right ...’ He raised his wand once more. ‘ Accio Dictionary!’ The heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the room, and Harry caught it. Goblet of Fire - page 303 - Bloomsbury - chapter 20, The First Task Harry did not say, \" Accio Rune Dictionary!\" I'm surprised he wasn't pelted by a variety of dictionaries that happened to be around when he practiced this time. Distance and Line of Sight: When Harry attempts to Accio Hagrid from the ground when Hagrid falls out of the motorbike, he is unsuccessful and later finds Hagrid lying spreadeagled on the ground after the motorbike crashes down from the sky. Harry was not able to see Hagrid when he performed Accio after Hagrid launches himself from the motorbike onto one of the Death Eaters' brooms mid-air and subsequently falls from Harry's sight. ( Deathly Hallows - The Seven Potters ) As a sidenote, it is possible to Accio living creatures; Harry Accios his toad in Potions in Order of the Phoenix (chapter 18, Dumbledore's Army ). However, Harry Accios his Firebolt from his room in Gryffindor Tower during the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament, sight unseen, from an ample distance. ( Goblet of Fire - The First Task ) Hermione seems to confirm that distance and line of sight is not an issue as long as the person casting the spell is concentrating fully. Concentration seems to trump distance and line of sight: ‘Harry, I really think you’ve got it!’ said Hermione, delightedly. ‘Just as long as it works tomorrow,’ Harry said. ‘The Firebolt’s going to be much further away than the stuff in here, it’s going to be in the castle, and I’m going to be out there in the grounds ...’ ‘That doesn’t matter,’ said Hermione firmly. ‘Just as long as you’re concentrating really, really hard on it, it’ll come.’ Goblet of Fire - page 303 - Bloomsbury - chapter 20, The First Task Other Actively Magic Items/Accio-ing Any Item: Harry successfully Accios the Triwizard Cup as he's clutching Cedric Diggory's body, while the cup was still activated as a Portkey. I thought it was interesting that Harry merely said, \" Accio !\" and not \" Accio Portkey!\" or \" Accio cup!\" ( Goblet of Fire - Priori Incantatum ) This reinforces Mrs Weasley's use of Accio under the Specificity of Items section. On the other hand, Accio doesn't work on Horcruxes, Harry's Invisibility Cloak (which is a Hallow, so presumably Accio might not work on the Resurrection Stone or the Elder Wand), or the Sword of Gryffindor. It seems there are items that are so magically powerful that a simple summoning charm doesn't affect them. In the Horcrux cave where the locket is hidden, Accio causes one of the Inferi to jump from the water, but then it splashes back down into the lake. Dumbledore believed that the Inferi's reaction was intuitive toward anyone who tried to take the Horcrux. jQuery/SQL where : Yes, it is possible to summon books with a keyword, such as 'Horcrux'. ‘I didn’t think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library?’ ‘There weren’t,’ said Hermione, who had turned pink. ‘Dumbledore removed them all, but he – he didn’t destroy them.’ Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed. ‘How in the name of Merlin’s pants have you managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books?’ ‘It – it wasn’t stealing!’ said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation. ‘They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really didn’t want anyone to get at them, I’m sure he would have made it much harder to –’ ‘Get to the point!’ said Ron. ‘Well ... it was easy,’ said Hermione in a small voice. ‘I just did a Summoning Charm. You know – accio. And – they zoomed out of Dumbledore’s study window right into the girls’ dormitory.’ Deathly Hallows - page 88 - Bloomsbury - chapter 6, The Ghoul in Pyjamas Another example from canon is Harry summoning brooms in Hogsmeade by saying, \" Accio Rosmerta's brooms !\" ( Half-Blood Prince - chapter 27, The Lightning-Struck Tower ) Vague Items: Could a person Accio a \"meal\"? I think probably. But they may not know what they'll be getting if they merely say, \" Accio , meal!\" However, if concentration is a big factor, perhaps they could Accio a meal of their choice as long as it's already prepared . Gamp's Five Laws of Elemental Transfiguration specifically states that food cannot be conjured from thin air. It can be conjured if it's already prepared (for example, the food at Hogwarts appearing on the students' plates is conjured (Transfigured) from the kitchens to the plates in the Great Hall). So if a plate of turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, and green beans is in the kitchen, it can be Accio'ed. If it's not there, then no dice. So, Accio socks? Sure. They might not be one's favorite pair, though. Accio pillow? It might not be the one you were hoping for (you know...the extra squashy one with the Slytherin pillowcase...) Accio-able Items: You mention water. The basic spell to summon water is Aguamenti, BUT I think if it were bottled water and one said, \" Accio , water!\" then the bottled water could be summoned. In Order of the Phoenix , Sirius summons everyone their own bottle of Butterbeer by saying, \" Accio , Butterbeer!\" Dirt? I don't see why not. Gases? Is a memory in a phial a gas? If it is some sort of gas, then, again, I don't see why not. I think it would depend on the gas in question. Rules About Accio Inferred: I think the biggest thing to note about Accio is that it is not always necessary to name the item you're summoning as you cast the spell. \" Accio !\" seems to be sufficient for many, many things. It seems the more dangerous or rare the item, the harder it is to Accio, even impossible in some circumstances (Horcruxes, Hallows, etc.). Otherwise, Accio seems to be a basically straightforward spell.",

This brings up another question: Why didn't Harry want to go to Slytherin? He didn't even know he was a wizard until a few days before and had no relatives who could tell him about Hogwarts. So why was he so adamant about Slytherin when he had no clue what the differences between the houses were? I have to say, I only saw the movies and didn't read the book - maybe there he is introduced into the houses before he is judged by the sorting hat ?",
        "answer": "Harry was opposed to becoming a Slytherin for three primary reasons; His visceral dislike of Draco Malfoy The fact that he receives a very negative impression of Slytherin from his newfound friends; a former Gryffindor (Hagrid), two current Gryffindors, (Ron's older brothers) and a would-be Gryffindor (Ron) The fact that the man who murdered his parents was in Slytherin House. He takes an immediate dislike to Draco (who seems confident that he'll be joining Slytherin): ‘Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been – imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?’ He learns (from Hagrid, whom he greatly admires) that Voldemort and most dark wizards and witches were members of Slytherin house: Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,’ said Hagrid darkly. ‘There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.’ ‘Vol– sorry – You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?’ ‘Years an’ years ago,’ said Hagrid. Harry gives us a major insight into his thought process when he speaks to Ron. Clearly the whole \"Voldemort was a Slytherin\" thing is weighing heavily on his mind: ‘Gryffindor,’ said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. ‘Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.’ ‘That’s the house Vol– I mean, You-Know-Who was in?’ He learns a little bit more about Slytherin house from the Sorting Hat as it praises traits that he has little affinity for; cunning, ambition and a willingness for ends to justify means: Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. He notes that the Slytherins look less than nice (although by this point, he's already been substantially influenced against them): ‘Bulstrode, Millicent’ then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked an unpleasant lot. His new arch-nemesis was just sorted into that house. Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, ‘SLYTHERIN!’ There's also a nice quote from the following book that indicates Harry's mental state “Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the house which had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other – but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione and the rest of the Weasleys. ” Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 5 (The Whomping Willow) Within the film version, it's also worth noting that when Minerva MacGonagoll reads out the names of the houses , there's more than a little disgust in her voice when she mentions Slytherin House. Harry would certainly have noticed.",

In the series, the only example of a wizard using muggle weaponry I can think of is Bellatrix Lestrange and her knife - being an evil sadist, she would probably enjoy using one against helpless victims because it's more gruesome than the relatively clean (if more painful) crucio curse. I can see why she'd use a knife. The valiant Gryffindor wouldn't want to cut someone up, so why did he ever acquire a sword (and an expensive goblin-made one, too) instead of relying on magic for self-defense?

In the days before the International Statute of Secrecy, when wizards mingled freely with Muggles, they would use swords to defend themselves just as often as wands. Indeed, it was considered unsporting to use a wand against a Muggle sword (which is not to say it was never done). Many gifted wizards were also accomplished duellists in the conventional sense, Gryffindor among them. Since this was written by JKR herself, we can accept this as a canon answer.",

        "answer": "He did not trust himself to have more power As a young man, Dumbledore was tempted by the idea of power over others. It’s how he was drawn in by Grindelwald’s anti-Muggle beliefs (that and his romantic infatuation with Grindelwald, I suppose). As such, he felt it was too dangerous for him to be in a position of responsibility in the magical community: “Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power .” “But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!” burst out Harry. “Would I?” asked Dumbledore heavily. “I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well. “ I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher—” Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows He may also have viewed it as a high calling He also seems to view it as one of the most important things a talented wizard can do: “I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Voldemort after a short pause. “I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school.” “Well,” said Dumbledore, still smiling, “to a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching too.” Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Of course, he’s talking about a sensitive subject here, and to Lord Voldemort no less, so it is possible he is not being entirely honest.

I have no source, just what the book lead me to believe: that the Portus charms were layered onto the Triwizard Cup like an onion. The innermost layer was the Portus charm to bring the winner back to the start of the maze. (cast first, either by the Ministry or Dumbledore). The outermost layer was the Portus charm cast by Barty Crouch Jr. to bring Harry to the graveyard. Once the outermost layer was used, then the innermost layer charm was active, which brought Harry back to the maze start.",

        "question": "Why did Voldemort assume that no-one knew about Room of Hidden Things?",
        "question_body": "Voldemort hid one of his Horcruxes inside Hogwarts. It seemed to be relying on security through obscurity as far as protecting it. But as we know, it ended up not being so secure because it wasn't so obscure - Harry Potter knew about the Room of Hidden Things. My question is, the way Rowling describes this hints at the fact that Riddle had an assumption that very few people would ever stumble upon that room. WHY??? First, let's show Harry's theory on what Voldemort was thinking, how and why: Here's Harry understanding Voldemort's thinking in HP7 once he figured out where the Diadem was (bold emphasis mine): Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school – here at least was a secret area he and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered – ...and later on, with Harry explains the location to Ron/Hermione: “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it . Come on.” “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence. “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. . Yet, from available evidence, that seems to be a completely wrong assumption, even at Voldemort's time . Let's examine that last quote again, with emphasis on other info available: “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. ” ... ... “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence. “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in my time... this way,” he added. “I think it’s down here... “ They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats... . OK, so if there's a truckload (or train-load, by the description) of stuff in that room, isn't the only reasonable conclusion: \"the room is a fairly popular destination with plenty of people who've found their way there in the past, and therefore, likely, plenty who will in the future\"? Doesn't matter what your arrogance level is, the evidence seems to point to only one conclusion - it's quite fine as a place to temporarily bury your dirt so teachers won't tag you for your misdeeds, but this is NOT the place to hide something that you want permanently safe! So why did Voldemort make such a moronic mistake?",
        "answer": "It's the room of requirement. Voldemort required a room to hide his item in. Where better to hide a small, reasonably nondescript item than in a pile of junk? If not then it's possible when he hid it it wasn't full of junk; Harry required a room full of all of the small, nondescript items that may have been the diadem. Yes he knew what it was but maybe not specifically enough to single it out. The room also has a habit of overdoing things, like when Dumbledore needs the loo and finds tens of chamberpots there, when one would do: \"Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it. Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the morning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon - or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder.\" ~Christmas Ball, Goblet of Fire,",

        "question_body": "There are three Unforgivable Curses: The Killing Curse ( Avada Kedavra ): Kills someone The Cruciatus Curse ( Crucio ): Causes pain The Imperius Curse ( Imperio ): Controls their will But what about the Memory Charm ( Obliviate )? Despite its label as a charm, shouldn't it be classified as an Unforgivable Curse? We see them quite clearly in Chamber of Secrets where by Lockhart's own admission, it has the power to make someone lose their minds: 'The adventure ends here, boys!' he said. 'I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. Say goodbye to your memories!' He raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, 'Obliviate!' Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - p.224 - Bloomsbury - Chapter 17, The Chamber of Secrets As Au101 wrote in this answer about why Gilderoy Lockhart couldn't recover from his backfired Memory Charm: \"'Say goodbye to your memories!'\" There's no talk of wiping out the last 24 hours or anything like that. \"[Y]ou two tragically lost your minds\", he's not just gonna do enough to get away with it. Wiping someone's mind permanently seems like a short step away from outright killing them. And even if they don't completely wipe their mind, it seems like a huge personal violation to tamper with another person's memories. You could make them forget something really precious to them (e.g. the day they met their spouse) or some harm that was done to them (e.g. abuse). Given all of this, why isn't the Memory Charm ( Obliviate ) an Unforgivable Curse? Or for that matter, why isn't it regulated at all?",
        "answer": "It's not an unforgivable curse because it's a standard spell, used all the times by the wizards who have to deal with muggles witnessing magic. ‘It’s like some sort of … I dunno … like some sort of rally,’ said Mr Roberts. ‘They all seem to know each other. Like a big party.’ At that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out of thin air next to Mr Roberts’s front door. ‘Obliviate!’ he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr Roberts. Instantly, Mr Roberts’s eyes slid out of focus, his brows unknitted and a look of dreamy unconcern fell over his face.

        "question_body": "Dolores Umbridge sent two Dementors to kiss Harry Potter illegally. She used a Blood Quill — a dark artifact — on at least two students — Harry and Lee Jordan. She was planning to use the Cruciatus — one of the Unforgivable Curses — on Harry to give up Dumbledore's location. She used what she thought was Veritaserum on Harry illegally. So, why was she not arrested immediately? In fact, it seems that she wasn't even fired from the Ministry when Scrimgeour became Minister.

The new Minister, Rufus Scrimgeour, had more immediate problems pressing in on him than Dolores Umbridge. Scrimgeour was later punished for this oversight, because the fact that the Ministry had never punished Dolores for her many abuses of power seemed to Harry Potter to reveal both its complacency and its carelessness. Harry considered Dolores’s continuing employment, and the lack of any repercussions for her behaviour at Hogwarts, a sign of the Ministry’s essential corruption, and refused to cooperate with the new Minister because of it.

        "question": "Why would Dumbledore say \"After all this time?\" to Snape?",
        "question_body": "When Snape's changed his allegiance from Voldemort to Dumbledore he did so expressly because he wanted to honour Lily's memory by protecting Harry. It was Dumbledore himself who persuaded him to take this course of action. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.” Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore’s words appeared to take a long time to reach him. “What — what do you mean?” “You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily’s son.” (Deathly Hallows, Chapter 33, The Prince's Tale) . If this was the basis on which Snape changed sides and the basis for Dumbledore's trust of Snape then why on earth would he be surprised, 15 years later, that Snape's motivations remain the same? Dumbledore seems genuinely surprised that Snape is still acting out of his love for Lily. He is confident that telling Snape that Harry must die won't cause him disquiet. He questions why Snape's motivations would be unchanged \"after all this time\". [Snape] stood up. “You have used me.” “Meaning?” “I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s son safe . Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter-” “But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously. “Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?” “For him?” shouted Snape. “ Expecto Patronum! ” From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: she landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. “ After all this time? ” “Always,” said Snape. (Deathly Hallows, Chapter 33, The Prince's Tale) . Bear in mind both that: Dumbledore was completely confident in Snape's loyalty. He trusted him implicitly and absolutely. The sole basis for Snape's loyalty, based on what Snape actually revealed to Dumbledore, was his commitment to protect Harry on Lily's behalf. Why does Dumbledore suddenly cast doubt on Snape's commitment to honouring Lily and protecting Harry here? Surely that was the basis for his allegiance to the Order all along? Doesn't Dumbledore's absolute trust of Snape imply that he was completely confident that Snape's motivations were unchanged?",
        "answer": "He's not referring to the commitment to the Order - he's referring to the Patronus, and what it represents. If the person you love has an animal form, your patronus can turn into something resembling them. Tonk's patronus became a wolf after she fell in love with Lupin. As Harry swung the cloak back over himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness. Chapter: Snape Victorious, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince This was a definite change, as Snape points out to her shortly afterwards (while being his usual prick self). And incidentally,\" said Snape, standing back to allow Harry to pass him, \"I was interested to see your new Patronus.\" [...] \"I think you were better off with the old one,\" said Snape, the malice in his voice unmistakable. \"The new one looks weak.\" Chapter: Snape Victorious, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Lily's patronus was a doe - either coincidentally or specifically because of James' Animagus form (probably the latter). You can't choose your Patronus. The fact that Snape's is a doe - is Lily - means that he still truly loves her, and that his feelings for her haven't weakened over the years. It's the depths of this love that hits Dumbledore so hard - that's the reason he gets tears in his eyes on seeing the Patronus. By \"After all this time?\" he means \"After all this time your feelings for her haven't changed, or dimmed, or faded?\"",

        "question": "What happened to Fawkes?",
        "question_body": "When Professor Dumbledore is killed and falls from the Astronomy Tower, Fawkes the phoenix is nowhere to be seen. IIRC, we don't see Fawkes in DH, so what happened to him? Did Fawkes just fly away or is he living on the grounds? Where did he go? He's a rare and loyal bird, so did he end up living with Harry and his family?",
        "answer": "Fawkes left After Dumbledore died, Fawkes's grief was apparent: Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. And Harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside him, not without: It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows. — Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Later, Harry noticed that Fawkes was done singing his lament, and concluded that he had left. “Dunno,” said Harry, lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards. He felt no curiosity at all about R.A.B.: He doubted that he would ever feel curious again. As he lay there, he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent. Fawkes had stopped singing. And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Harry. — Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince However, it is possible that Fawkes left somewhat later. He may have remained for the funeral, although it is ambiguous. White smoke spiraled into the air and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledore’s body and the table on which he had rested. — Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Why didn't he stay? Fawkes has always been associated with Dumbledore . He flew to Dumbledore after saving Harry in the Chamber of Secrets: Professor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Fawkes went whooshing past Harry’s ear and settled on Dumbledore’s shoulder , just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs. Weasley’s tight embrace. — Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Indeed, as an indication of the strength of the bond between Fawkes and Dumbledore, the latter's Patronus is a phoenix : Question: What form does Dumbledore’s Patronus take? JKR: Good question. Can anyone guess? You have had a clue. There was a little whisper there. It is a phoenix, which is very representative of Dumbledore for reasons that I am sure you can guess. Fawkes was called to the Chamber by the strength of Harry's loyalty to Dumbledore. “First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,” said Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again. “You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.” He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee. — Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets This, more than anything else, demonstrates that Fawkes and Dumbledore are in some sense interchangeable. Loyalty to Fawkes is loyalty to Dumbledore, and vice versa. As indicated in this answer , the authorial reason for Fawkes's departure was that \"something had to leave the school\" when Dumbledore died. It goes beyond that, though: the departure of Fawkes is essentially the departure of Dumbledore. Fawkes and Dumbledore had had a great deal of time to develop such a connection. They had most likely been together since before Voldemort purchased his wand : “Exactly,” said Dumbledore. “Harry’s wand and Voldemort’s wand share cores. Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix. This phoenix, in fact,” he added, and he pointed at the scarlet-and-gold bird, perching peacefully on Harry’s knee. “My wand’s feather came from Fawkes?” Harry said, amazed. “Yes,” said Dumbledore. — Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire This would have been nearly 60 years (from 1938 to 1998). In many ways, Fawkes was Albus Dumbledore's closest friend. For a phoenix, a generally independent creature, to spend sixty years with a wizard speaks to the depth of their friendship. Fawkes and Dumbledore had decades to build their relationship. Harry had known him for only a tenth of that time, and barely interacted with him. Fawkes was Dumbledore's friend: not Harry's, not the Order's mascot. He stayed at Hogwarts out of love for Dumbledore. When his friend died, Fawkes had no reason to remain.

(Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 10, Hallowe'en) . At first this seems like the standard ironic wizarding response to Muggle society. 'Magic is normal, Muggles are weird and so why would any wizards know anything about the strange ways of Muggles?' and so on. Yet, barely a page later, Wood is shown to not only be aware of golf but to have a whole collection of Muggle golf balls. \"We won't practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate. \"It's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try you out with a few of these.\" He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket, and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch. (Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 10, Hallowe'en) . If Wood doesn't know anything about basketball then how could he know anything about golf? His basketball comment could only come from someone who was completely clueless about even the most basic elements of that sport. He hasn't even heard of it. So how did he come to have his stash of golf balls? Is there some magical connection with golf that I'm not aware of? Or is there some way in which Wood may have come across golf balls whilst not encountering basketball?",
        "answer": "Obviously, any answer to this would be speculative, but my guess is that they aren't Wood's. The crate of Quidditch balls almost certainly isn't, so why would the golfballs be? Considering Wood never identifies them as golfballs, it's entirely plausible that, they were simply stored in the broomshed as a training tool, and were left there by a muggleborn player or captain. If you've ever been in a sports storage closet at a school, they're always full of the strangest stuff.

Most of which reasons boil down to basic game theory and human nature. The main possible reasons (or their combinations) being: They lust for real power. Being \"enslaved\" by Voldie while lording it over pretty much everyone else doesn't sound like a bad deal to a LOT of people. The kinds that make the best lieutenants. See Malfoys. They are just generally evil, and will gladly follow someone who enables their evil inclinations to be expressed. See Crabb/Goyle types for small-time kind of example, or Dolores Umbridge for larger. Or Malfoys again (or better yet the psychopath/sociopath Lestrange). They agree with Dark Helmet's axiom that \"Evil will always triumph because Good is… DUMB\". And they want to be on the winning side. They (despite never having seen Spaceballs) make a rational assumption that Voldemort will win based on his power/history. And they want to be on the winning side. They agree with Death Eaters/Voldemort's politics (wizards should rule over Muggles, stronger wizards should rule over weaker ones). See Malfoys. But MANY MANY would agree (think how many people bought into Hitler's Master Race idea, both within and outside of Germany, and that was given a TOTAL absence of a proof, as opposed to having magical powers vs. not). Blood purity was a big thing in Wizarding world, both in the past (elaborated a lot on Pottermore) and in the present (Fudge, Umbridge etc...) They are weak personalities easily swayed by a crowd or a strong charismatic leader (which Tom Riddle most certainly was). See Peter Pettigrew/Wormtail. The \"enemy of my enemy\" factor - someone hates a specific Muggle/wizard, and Death Eaters provide both a means of revenge AND moral support. See Snape vs. James Potter. The friendship/other relationship factor. Your family belongs to Death Eaters or your best friend is one, and you follow. See many Slytherins (e.g. Crabb, Goyle, Draco). They are afraid of Voldemort. Same reason MANY MANY people joined Communist party or Nazis or the gangs - if you don't, you will be hurt for not doing so. Likely example is Karkaroff. Most are not smart enough to realize that any possible payoff from being a Death Eater is counteracted by the problems which Mark raised. See real life example of any American/Western leftie \"intellectuals\" who worshipped Stalin (hint - the same kind most of which would get put up to a wall and shot if they lived in Soviet Russia); or the dumbhead Santana who wears a Che Guevara T-shirt, ignoring the fact that Che hated Rock, never mind was a mass-murdering sociopath. For many, being \"enslaved\" by Voldemort isn't that much of a deal - in reality they are just low-level followers of a faction/army and the alternative is a low-paying wizard job/unemployment/unfulfilling life.",

Read on: \"Here is the thing: for convenience, I had Dumbledore say to Harry, \"You were the Horcrux he never meant to make,\" but I think, by definition, a Horcrux has to be made intentionally . So because Voldemort never went through the grotesque process that I imagine creates a Horcrux with Harry, (SU: Mm-hm.) it was just that he had destabilized his soul so much that it split when he was hit by the backfiring curse. And so this part of it flies off, and attaches to the only living thing in the room. A part of it flees in the very-close-to-death limbo state that Voldemort then goes on and exists in. I suppose it's very close to being a Horcrux, but Harry did not become an evil object . He didn't have curses upon him that the other Horcruxes had. He himself was not contaminated by carrying this bit of parasitic soul.\" [SNIP] \"I do think that the strict definition of \"Horcrux,\" once I write the [Harry Potter Encyclopedia], will have to be given, and that the definition will be that a receptacle is prepared by Dark Magic to become the receptacle of a fragmented piece of soul, and that that piece of soul was deliberately detached from the master soul to act as a future safeguard, or anchor, to life, and a safeguard against death.\" JK Rowling - Pottercast 12.23.07 - The Leaky Cauldron No, Harry was not an official Horcrux. There is a spell used to complete the process, which JKR has not yet revealed. From Half-Blood Prince : A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.\" \"I don't quite understand how that works, though, sir,\" said Riddle. His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement. \"Well, you split your soul, you see,\" said Slughorn, \"and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form ...\" Slughorn's face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before: \"I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive.\" \"... few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.\" But Riddle's hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing. \"How do you split your soul?\" \"Well,\" said Slughorn uncomfortably, \"you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.\" \"But how do you do it?\" \"By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By commiting murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —\" \"Encase?

I can see History of Magic as practical. I know of Arithmancy, but that's the study of the magical properties of numbers, not math. Since Hogsmead is one of the very last all-magical towns, it's a fair assumption that a majority of the students at Hogwarts will be living in non-magical towns or cities. If practical classes (like math or English) aren't taught, then how do these students function in the non-magical cities?",
        "answer": "History of Magic and Muggle Studies are both indeed non-magical classes. History of Magic is probably more immersed in the study of magical topics than is Muggle Studies. Astronomy is another discipline taught at Hogwart which straddles the magical/Muggle worlds. Study of the stars. I can see Divination as being mostly non-magical, at least how its described in canon. There is the reading of tea leaves (non-magical equipment), presumably the reading of tarot cards and the like, and reading crystal balls (the one item that I think could possibly have more magical properties). Hermione describes Divination as \"a very woolly discipline\" in Prisoner of Azkaban , which I interpret to mean she doesn't find it particularly useful or possibly non-magical or less magical. She sees Divination as subjective. Frankly, in the end, Divination came in use when Professor Trelawney provided crystal balls as weapons during the Battle of Hogwarts. Note: I see the ability to receive Harry's prophecy on Trelawney's part as separate from the actual course material taught in Divination the class. Certainly there are many \"psychics\" who hang out their shingle all over the Muggle world, not to mention religious practices that use symbols, interpretation of texts, objects, and incantations as part of their worship. Herbology might include some knowledge that could cross over into the Muggle world, such as growing potions ingredients that both magical and Muggle folk use for making potions and herbal tinctures/supplements respectively. If you look at the list of known potions ingredients at the Harry Potter Lexicon , you will find ingredients that are just naturally occurring in the world, and are not strictly magical plants or herbs. ETA: The study of Ancient Runes might help prepare for a career in archeology, if a magical child were to take that route. Runes are found in the Muggle world and are not exclusive to the Wizarding world. I think that Squibs would need a strictly Muggle education in order to get by in the world. Ron Weasley confides that a family member (a cousin, I believe) is an accountant but the family \"doesn't talk about him much.\" Otherwise, magical folk seem to stay fairly insular, working in magical jobs and careers. REPHRASED: Some professions, whether wizarding or Muggle, require advanced math and/or science. Canon does not explain how a magical child would receive advanced instruction in math or science at Hogwarts, or should their chosen career path call for it. Perhaps advanced skills are taught through apprenticeships (canon mentions wandmakers study under other wandmakers to learn wandlore) or specialized on-the-job training (such as an Auror might receive). Many people -- magical or not -- are able to go day-to-day using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and fractions, even though they've been taught advanced math, such as algebra, calculus, and trigonometry. How relevant advanced math will be will vary profession to profession. Most children -- again, magical or not -- are familiar with basic math by the time they leave elementary school, so this kind of learning would precede a Hogwarts education, as Hogwarts students are either in Muggle primary schools or homeschooled prior to going to Hogwarts (no mention is made of all magical elementary schools in the Wizarding world). The skill of writing is reinforced at Hogwarts through essay writing; it's just that the subject matter is magical, not Muggle. Also, (POTTERMORE SPOILER) Pottermore states that some students are allowed to study Alchemy at Hogwarts and receive special instruction in that discipline. Alchemy could be related to chemistry, which could be bridged between the magical and Muggle world.",

        "question": "Why do less-bright students end up in Slytherin?",
        "question_body": "The main trait of Slytherin house is ambition and cunning. Malfoy fits the bill. Snape fits the bill. Harry Potter has both, to an extent. But how can someone argue that Crabbe, Goyle or Millicent (or Pansy if Hermione is to be believed, though she's a bit biased) are intelligent enough to be ambitious (never mind cunning)?",
        "answer": "Your House can represent traits you value, not necessarily have. This is a good explanation for all the Sortings that that don't seem to match up with the student's traits. Peter Pettigrew could have been a Gryffindor because he wanted to be brave, not because he was. Although he did develop courage later on, unlike Pettigrew, the same thing could be said for Neville Longbottom. Hermione Granger would have probably been a Ravenclaw based solely on her traits, but apparently she valued bravery more, as evidenced by her telling Harry that friendship and bravery were more important than books and cleverness. “I’m not as good as you,’ said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. ‘Me!’ said Hermione. ‘Books! And cleverness! There are more important things – friendship and bravery and – oh Harry – be careful!” - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 16 (Through the Trapdoor) There, she basically stated herself that she valued Gryffindor traits over Ravenclaw traits. Students also tend to be put in the house they want to be in most. Choice also is a part of each Sorting, so if someone wants badly enough to be in a particular House, then they probably will be. Hermione showed a clear preference for Gryffindor over Ravenclaw when she was talking to Ron and Harry on the Hogwarts Express. “I’ve been asking around and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best, I hear Dumbledore himself was one, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad …” - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 6 (The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters) There's never been a case where a student is shown to be thoroughly unhappy with their Hogwarts House in the seven books, so it seems likely that the Sorting Hat does place some importance on the student's opinions. There’s also never been a case in the seven books where a student really wants a particular house and is sorted elsewhere. Out-of-universe answer - Rowling wanted all the bad guys to be in Slytherin. Over the course of the series, Slytherin is used as the 'evil' House, where everyone bad goes whether they have cunning and ambition or not. Some of them did actually have Slytherin traits - like the Dark Lord himself, who was undeniably both cunning and ambitious. However, others, like Crabbe and Goyle, had none of the defining Slytherin traits. But to fit the idea of Slytherin being the 'evil' House, they were put in Slytherin without any further thought as to why they belonged there other than that they were the bad guys.",

        "question": "Why do Hogwarts teachers have such strange names?",
        "question_body": "Look at the first names of the Hogwarts staff we know of: Albus, Minerva, Severus, Filius, Remus, Pomona, Quirinus, Gilderoy, (Argus), ... Most of these sound like ancient Roman or Greek names. Compare with the names of students: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, George, Neville, Seamus, Dean, Luna, Vincent, Cedric, Ernie, Pansy, Millicent, Hannah, Percy, ... All of these are perfectly ordinary modern English names. Even the names of adults who aren't Hogwarts teachers: Molly, Arthur, Cornelius, Amos, Tom, James, Lily, Peter, ... A couple of these sound quite old-fashioned but still plausible as modern English names. Why do Hogwarts professors have such archaic names while other people don't?",
        "answer": "Out of universe, JKR quite obviously wanted to show their personalities. Albus is the Latin word for white , whose defining visual trait is his white hair and beard Severus coming from severe, he's very severe and strict. As Null points out in the comments, there is also a strong parallel with the Roman emperor Severus Minerva was the Roman goddess of wisdom, she's an extremely wise woman Filius is the Latin word for son, my interpretation of this is simply that Flitwick is described as being a very small man Remus is one of the founders of Rome, who was raised by a wolf, demonstrating his condition Pomona was the Roman goddess of fruitful abundance, suiting her post as herbology teacher Quirinus was another name for Janus, the Roman god of two faces (no need to explain that freaky little connection - thank you Alarion for this contribution). It's also a Latin adjective meaning wielder of the spear , as he is the defense against the dark arts teacher Gilderoy was the name of two different highway men who were both described as being very handsome, which JKR found in a book ( Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable ). Gilded is also a good connection to this name, a gold plating or a front, which is Lockhart all over (thank you again Alarion for this contribution also) Argus comes from Greek myth, Argos was a watchman with hundreds of eyes (much like Filch and his cat). As you can see from the books, these names are all very linked to the characters' personalities. As for an in-universe answer, the students are much younger than almost all of the professors at Hogwarts, who are mostly at least 2 (maybe even 3) generations older than the students. This archaic use of names can simply be down to this generation gap.",

        "question": "Why don't Wizards use wrist straps to protect against disarming charms?",
        "question_body": "Inspired by a tweet by rocket : me: see the wrist strap stops you from dropping the wiimote voldemort: this is brilliant [later] harry potter: expelliarmus! voldemort: [wand dangling from wrist] lmao nice try I know this is just a joke tweet, but it feels like a wrist strap like that could really provide the benefit of being protected against Expelliarmus casts. Is there an explanation (no matter whether in-universe or out-of-universe) why wizards don't use something like this? A reply to the tweet mentioned that the Wii wasn't yet around in the 90s, but I very much doubt the Wii was the first time a wrist strap was used to protect against flying handheld objects.",
        "answer": "The Disarming Charm is used to disarm someone, funnily enough, that is, it will send whatever someone is holding out of their hands should the spell be powerful enough. Therefore, we have one main thing to consider, is the strap part of the wand or not? If it is then should the spell be strong enough the wand and strap should still go flying which is likely to injure you. If not the wand could still go flying and injure your hand should the spell be powerful. In the duel between Snape and Lockhart, Snape's Expelliarmus is so powerful it sends Lockhart himself flying. Imagine what the strap would do to your hand should it be attached. Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried: “Expelliarmus!” There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , Chapter 11, \"The Duelling Club\" Even a normal successful Disarming Charm is usually described as sending the wand high into the air. For example, “Expelliarmus.” Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew; Lupin’s wand flew high into the air and out of sight. “Stay where you are!” Harry shouted, running forward. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , Chapter 20, \"The Dementor's Kiss\" So in conclusion it seems like the wand would leave the hand at quite a speed and that is sure to do some damage to your arm/hand should you be wearing a strap. Even if that doesn't happen you can even be knocked off your feet and sent flying yourself at the same time which the strap doesn't protect against. Snape himself was even knocked out by the Disarming Charm from flying into a wall, though he did have 3 cast on him at once. “Expelliarmus!” he yelled — except that his wasn’t the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out. Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment. Snape’s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , Chapter 19, \"The Servant of Lord Voldemort\"",

        "question": "Why is killing someone using the Avada Kedavra spell considered worse or different than killing him with any other means?",
        "question_body": "What's the deal with Avada Kedavra? It kills its target, fine, but so do many other things. Why is Avada Kedavra specifically banned, rather than banning \"killing people\"? Why is killing someone using that specific magic considered worse or different than killing them with any other means?",
        "answer": "I think part of the premise of your question is incorrect. Murder is considered a crime in the wizarding world, just as it is among the Muggles. If a wizard kills another wizard with a gun or a knife, I'm sure it would be punished accordingly. In the books, we are told that Avada Kedavra is one of the three Unforgivable Curses, along with Cruciatus (pain) and Imperius (mind control). (As I recall they first appear in Goblet of Fire .) These three have no legitimate purpose and, as we see in the later books, they make it very easy to do horrible things to people. Therefore they are banned. The point about Avada Kedavra is that it's a weapon . Wizards are not allowed to use it for the same reason that people in Britain are not allowed to carry handguns. If a British person used an illegal handgun to commit murder, this would be treated as an aggravating circumstance and result in a harsher sentence. We can assume the same would hold true in the wizarding world. Also, it's important to remember that wizards carry their wands at all times. So they could use Avada Kedavra any time they want; it's a similar situation to the Old West of cowboy movies, where everyone is carrying a loaded gun. The only reason the wizarding world does not degenerate into an OK-Corral level of violence is a very strong social taboo against using magic to kill people. Edit: [This edit may be incorrect, see discussion of Moogle's answer.] As pointed out by Moogle, Avada Kedavra requires a strong degree of anger and desire to kill the other person. So it's as if someone in our world killed another person in a particularly violent and sadistic fashion. That would also be considered an aggravating circumstance.",

        "question_body": "In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, when the kids and Arthur get to The Burrow from Privet Drive and Molly is cooking and raging about Fred and George's shenanigans, the following occurs: Mrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it. A creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred. In Deathly Hallows , Hermione says that this is not possible: “Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,” said Hermione. “no one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfigura—” “Oh, speak English, can’t you?” Ron said, prising a fish out from between his teeth. “It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you’ve already got some—” So how was Molly causing sauce to pour from her wand, seemingly out of thin air?",
        "answer": "Since we know that real food can't be created from nothingness , that leaves us with a few options: Molly is summoning the sauce from somewhere else, presumably elsewhere in the kitchen (decidedly possible. We see this happen repeatedly in the Hogwarts Dining Hall). There was already some sauce in the pan and she's using a spell to make it expand (unlikely, given how clean she likes to keep them). She's transforming something else in the kitchen into the sauce (like how a trek-style replicator works). Or my personal favourite explanation; Like Leprechaun gold, food that is created using magic will evidently dissipate after a while. Molly is conjuring a magic sauce to bulk out the real food (perhaps a low quality meat). As long as there's some nutritious content, when the sauce goes 'poof' they won't starve. This also explains why Ron and his brothers are so skinny despite everyone in the family taking second servings.",

In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone however, Harry, Ron, and Hermione, three 11 year-olds, manage to get through seven magical obstacles designed to protect the Sorcerer's (Philosopher's) Stone. If it was possible for three first year kids to get through the obstacles, then how was the Stone well protected at at all. Did Dumbledore really expect that the teachers' defenses would work against Voldemort?",
        "answer": "Let's step through all the obstacles. Idiot Test The door was locked and required Alohomora . Fluffy This giant, three-headed dog fiercely guarded the trapdoor leading into the actual chamber. I suppose that it would be possible to fight your way past it, but it was such a confined space and the dog was so big that it would be nearly impossible. Even for someone like Voldemort, I suspect that it would be difficult to kill Fluffy without waking up the whole castle or alerting the staff to his presence. The gang (Harry, Ron, Hermione) was able to get past Fluffy because they knew that music would put Fluffy to sleep. Devil's Snare Designed to kill anyone who landed in it, the Devil's Snare was a very clever means of thwarting thieves. One can't fight their way out of it, they have to use a spell. Knowing that Devil's Snare doesn't like heat probably isn't common knowledge in the wizarding community. But due to the fact the Hermione pays attention in herbology, the group can move on. Key Room Filled with flying keys, this room will stop anyone from advancing that can't find the key to the door. Good thing that the group had a quidditch prodigy with them to help them catch the key. Giant Chess Set The only way to move on here is to checkmate the enemy king. Because Ron managed to win against the chess set, it is safe to assume that the other side was not really playing to win, but rather seeking to divide any groups that had made it this far. Or Ron is really good at chess. Troll room In all honesty this isn't a very good obstacle. If you already got past Fluffy then the troll shouldn't be that big of a problem. This is probably by professor Quirrell's design because he wanted to eventually steal the stone for his master. Although if it wasn't already knocked out then Harry and Hermione would've had quite a problem on their hands. Potion Room Containing seven unlabeled potions, this room represents one of the hardest challenges to thieves: \"Brilliant. This isn't magic — it's logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here for ever.\" -Hermione So Snape's puzzle tests something that none of the others do: that you can logically work through situations. This obstacle also divides groups up because there is only enough potion to take one person through the fire (It is unknown whether Quirrell drank half the potion or it refilled itself, in either case it was still a small vial). Because Hermione was there Harry was able to go on (not that he wouldn't be able to solve it on his own, but it certainly have taken a while). The Mirror of Erised One of Dumbledoe's more brilliant ideas, as he puts it, is to not allow anyone who wants to use the stone to have it. The only way to get the stone is to see yourself possessing it in the mirror. This is what makes the stone very, very well protected. Anyone that wanted to use the stone for their own purposes simply couldn't have it. Conclusion The stone is in fact very well protected. The group had a very specific set of skills that allowed them to advance as far as they did, and because Harry had no selfish intentions, was granted the stone.",

Which is why it's surprising when she only gets Exceeds Expectations. “Hermione?” said Ginny tentatively, for Hermione still hadn’t turned around. “How did you do?” “I - not bad,” said Hermione in a small voice. “Oh, come off it,” said Ron, striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand. “Yep - nine ‘Outstandings’ and one ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at Defense Against the Dark Arts.” He looked down at her, half-amused, half-exasperated. “You’re actually disappointed, aren’t you?” (Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 5, An Excess of Phlegm) . It's especially strange that Hermione got top grades in literally every other subject. Why didn't she get an O in Defence Against the Dark Arts?",
        "answer": "The answer is most likely the reason that Dumbledore's Army was created. ‘Parvati Patil, and isn’t there a practical bit in our Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL? Aren’t we supposed to show that we can actually do the counter-curses and things?’ ‘As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,’ said Professor Umbridge dismissively. ‘Without ever practising them beforehand?’ said Parvati incredulously. ‘Are you telling us that the first time we’ll get to do the spells will be during our exam?’ Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , chapter 12 While Hermione almost certainly got a perfect on her written exam, the fact that for the entire year they never actually practiced any of the spells in class could have still affected her grade. While Harry was teaching them different defensive tactics in the Dumbledore's Army, he was teaching them very practical spells, that may or may not have actually been the spells they would cover in year 5. Especially since he was doing both basic spells such as disarming, as well as N.E.W.T. level spells such as patronus charms. Hermione also historically has done poorly on defense against the dark arts practicals. Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the Boggart in it. After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming. ‘Hermione!’ said Lupin, startled. ‘What’s the matter?’ ‘P-P-Professor McGonagall!’ Hermione gasped, pointing into the trunk. ‘Sh-she said I’d failed everything!’ It took a little while to calm Hermione down. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , chapter 16 Hermione even admits that Harry is better at Defence against the Dark Arts: ‘Harry, you’re the best in the year at Defence Against the Dark Arts,’ said Hermione. ‘Me?’ said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. ‘No I’m not, you’ve beaten me in every test –’ ‘Actually, I haven’t,’ said Hermione coolly. ‘You beat me in our third year – the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But I’m not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you’ve done !’ Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , chapter 15 Otherwise, like Radhil said, it was probably Rowling's decision to make it apparent that Harry is the best at Defense against the Dark Arts.",

        "question": "Why weren't Fred and George Weasley Placed in Ravenclaw?",
        "question_body": "Yes, you read that right. Fred and George are perhaps the most Ravenclaw characters in the entire series, and this is why: Relevant passages from the Ravenclaw welcome message (out of order for convenience, emphasis mine): Professor Flitwick : You’ll like our Head of house, Professor Filius Flitwick . . . His office door is always open to any Ravenclaw with a problem, and if you’re in a real state he’ll get out these delicious little cupcakes he keeps in a tin in his desk drawer and make them do a little dance for you. In fact, it’s worth pretending you’re in a real state just to see them jive. As the head of the house, Professor Flitwick is the exemplary Ravenclaw, and he is very similar to F&G. They may love their tricks, but their main goal is always to brighten someone's day (and they would definitely appreciate dancing cupcakes). Additionally, Flitwick was impressed by the twins's wits and charms abilities: “Well, Flitwick’s got rid of Fred and George’s swamp,” said Ginny. “He did it in about three seconds. But he left a tiny patch under the window and he’s roped it off —” “Why?” said Hermione, looking startled. “Oh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic ,” said Ginny, shrugging. “I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George ,” said Ron through a mouthful of chocolate. Fred and George are geniuses , brilliant, creative. In other words, the ultimate Ravenclaws: Another cool thing about Ravenclaw is that our people are the most individual – some might even call them eccentrics . But geniuses are often out of step with ordinary folk , and unlike some other houses we could mention, we think you’ve got the right to wear what you like, believe what you want, and say what you feel . We aren’t put off by people who march to a different tune ; on the contrary, we value them! . . . Most of the greatest wizarding inventors and innovators were in our house . . . There was also Minister Lorcan McLaird, who was a quite brilliant wizard, but preferred to communicate by puffing smoke out of the end of his wand. Well, I did say we produce eccentrics . In fact, we are also the house that gave the wizarding world Uric the Oddball , who used a jellyfish for a hat. He’s the punch line of a lot of wizarding jokes . If these words didn't bring the Weasley twins to your mind, you should probably read the Harry Potter books. The Weasley twins are two of the most brilliant minds Hogwarts has ever seen. They figured out how to use the Marauders Map, invented their own products, started a successful business at 17, and were witty beyond belief. They are obviously very talented at charms because Umbridge, an adult wizard, couldn't get rid of their mayhem. So, except for \"they are Weasleys and Weasleys are Gryffindors\", why aren't they in Ravenclaw? All in all, did the sorting hat drop the hat on this one?",
        "answer": "The Hat Knows Best It would be pure speculation for anyone to say where they would have done better, you can't predict what experiences they would have had in any of the other houses. Any of these experiences could have changed their future for the better or worse. Also let's not forget that they did possibly one of the least Ravenclaw like things to do, they left school never to return before getting their grades. They were brave enough to risk it all on a business gamble not to mention brave enough to stand up to Umbridge and disrupt an exam as well as a variety of other pranks they pulled, all requiring a brave disregard for the rules. Hatstalls There is nothing explicitly mentioned about the time it took the Sorting Hat to decide the houses of any of the Weasleys, which I'm sure Ron would have recounted to Harry when Ron was feeling glum about the sorting ceremony. “What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry. “Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. Hatstalls are rare but happen when there are strong possibilities that the sorting candidate could be great in more than one house, for example Ravenclaw Head of House Filius Flitwick and Gryffindor Head of House Minerva McGonagall Minerva drew unusual attention to herself on her very first evening, when she was revealed to be a Hatstall. After five and a half minutes, the Sorting Hat, which had been vacillating between the houses of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor, placed Minerva in the latter. (In later years, this circumstance was a subject of gentle humour between Minerva and her colleague Filius Flitwick, over whom the Sorting Hat suffered the same confusion, but reached the opposite conclusion. The two Heads of house were amused to think that they might, but for those crucial moments in their youths, have exchanged positions). Pottermore - Professor McGonagall It seems interesting that both the current Heads of House could have been swapped, and relevant for the case in hand. The fact both are incredibly brave and incredibly smart (or innovative, creative, geniuses whatever classification you want to use) does not limit them into one house or the other. The house a student is assigned is The Sorting Hat's interpretation of where they will best fit in (remember this hat was crafted by the Hogwarts founders) so I'm fairly certain it works well enough and better than you or I could speculate. The only true Hatstalls known personally to Harry Potter were Minerva McGonagall and Peter Pettigrew. The former caused the hat to agonise for five and a half minutes as to whether Minerva ought to go to Ravenclaw or Gryffindor; the latter was placed in Gryffindor after a long deliberation between that house and Slytherin. The Sorting Hat, which is infamously stubborn, still refuses to accept that its decision in the case of the latter may have been erroneous, citing the manner in which Pettigrew died as (dubious) evidence. Pottermore - Hatstalls The Sorting Hat has seemingly never believed itself to be wrong, and is also seemingly only challenged in cases of Hatstalls. There is no mention of Fred and George or any Weasley family members coming close to being Hatstalls. They Were Incredibly Brave - Section in Progress They were brave enough to mock Voldemort during Half Blood Prince they have this sign outside their shop in Diagon Alley: WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOUKNOWWHO? YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT UNOPOO– THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THAT’S GRIPPING THE NATION! Harry started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster. Her lips moved silently, mouthing the name “UNoPoo.” “They’ll be murdered in their beds!” she whispered.",

        "question_body": "Ron Weasley has his pitiful pet rat Scabbers with him from almost the get-go. This rat is brought with Ron to Hogwarts for multiple years, and presumably Percy brought Scabbers to Hogwarts when he owned the rat. Now the papers that Harry received with his acceptance letter clearly stated that a student may bring with them an owl OR a cat OR a toad. Nowhere is it mentioned that, should they be unable to afford an owl, a cat or a toad, then they may bring a rat. But no one at Hogwarts seemed to take notice or mention this fact. So why was it that Ron (and presumably Percy) were permitted to bring a rat to Hogwarts?",
        "answer": "There are plenty of examples of students breaking the rules in Hogwarts and getting away with it (e.g. Fred, George, Harry). If bringing rats to Hogwarts was not allowed, Ron would not be the first person to break a rule and get away with it. Also, that letter never says that you can't bring any pet other than an Owl, Cat, or Toad. My guess is that part of the letter is more of a guideline than a rule. Remember that lots of witches and wizards come from muggle families, and they might have trouble adjusting to their new school. A pet would help with that, and by suggesting some magical pets Hogwarts is making their lives a lot easier.",

        "question": "Did Dumbledore lie to Harry about how long he had James Potter's invisibility cloak when he was examining it? If so, why?",
        "question_body": "Sorry if this is too long! I think it's different to previous questions... In 'King's Cross', Dumbledore claims that James had showed him the cloak \"just a few days previously\" to the attack on Godric's Hollow (31st October, 1981), indicating he only possessed it for the purpose of examining it for a few days . You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it . Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Chapter 35: King's Cross However, from Lily's letter to Sirius we see that this cannot be possible, since Dumbledore clearly had the cloak from around Harry's birthday, 31st July. Note that this letter was written as a thank you letter for the present Sirius got Harry for his birthday. Dear Padfoot, Thank you, thank you, for Harry’s birthday present! It was his favorite by far [...] We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on Harry. We were so sorry you couldn’t come, but the Order’s got to come first, and Harry’s not old enough to know it’s his birthday anyway ! James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell—also Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak , so no chance of little excursions. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Chapter 10: Kreacher's Tale Even allowing for a few days of response time after a birthday for a 'thank you' letter, it seems to me that there is very little chance of Lily having written this later than early August, following Harry's birthday. Dumbledore still had the cloak when the Potters were killed (31st October) and so this leaves a gap of almost three months when Dumbledore must have had the cloak, not the \"just a few days previously\" he claims at King's Cross. This is rather a long time to \"borrow\" something so precious! First I thought he was feeling guilty for having deprived the Potters of a powerful magical object in a time of great peril, but in response to Dumbledore's statement earlier, Harry attempts to reassure him: \"The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,\" Harry said quickly. \"Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn’t have made them curse-proof.\" \"True,\" sighed Dumbledore. \"True.\" Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Chapter 35: King's Cross The best theory I have come across thus far is that Dumbledore was ashamed of his obsession with the Hallows and so lied to Harry about how long he had the cloak. http://dlewis.net/blog/2017/04/11/harry-potter-and-the-problem-with-the-pensieve-memories/ - (the relevant material starts Theory 3 - Part 1 Dumbledore's lie). However, I do not find this entirely convincing, as Dumbledore is seemingly at his lowest point of self-loathing here and has very little to gain from lying - he is trying to get Harry to despise him : \"You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.” “But I don’t despise you —” “Then you should,” said Dumbledore. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Chapter 35: King's Cross Do you believe the summarised theory presented in the blog I linked or do you find it more credible that Lily wrote the letter just before Halloween? It seems unlikely the Potters would be struggling to communicate with the outside world, given that they had contact with other people (Bathilda and Wormtail) during that time, so sending an owl to Sirius is unlikely to have been so difficult as to take three months to achieve. (I also do not believe they would have intentionally delayed replying so long to thank someone for a birthday present!) My only other theory is that Rowling simply made a mistake, which I think I tend towards, but it seems so obvious an oversight! TL;DR Dumbledore's statement about when he has the cloak contradicts the approximate date in Lily's letter when she states Dumbledore takes the cloak - is he lying (and why?) or is this just JKR oversight?",
        "answer": "It's hard to give a definitive answer to this question because there is conflicting information, but here are a few points: Note the wording of the letter: \"Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak\". This indicates that Sirius was already aware that Dumbledore borrowed it, and Lily is merely telling him that Dumbledore has not returned it yet. If Dumbledore had borrowed the cloak after Harry's birthday then this letter would necessarily be at least the second communication to Sirius since the birthday. As such it would be odd that Lily is first talking about Harry's birthday in this letter, and not in the previous communication. The contents of this letter imply that it is the first communication to Sirius since Harry's birthday. This would point to the fact that Dumbledore had borrowed the cloak before Harry's birthday, which means he indeed must have had it for at least three months contrary to his statement to Harry. On the other hand, when Harry reads the letter he seems to assume that it was written shortly before his parents' death: Wormy was here ... Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed \"down,\" had he? Was he aware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for the last time? Harry, who knew that there was a three month gap between his birthday and his parents death, still seemed to think that \"last weekend\" could have been the last time Pettigrew would see Harry's parents, which would likely place it much closer to Halloween than to Harry's birthday. However, it is possible that Harry didn't really fully think it through, and/or he simply made a mistake. Another clue from the letter is the following line: but that was probably the news about the McKinnons; We don't know much about the McKinnons, but Moody gives us one bit of information about them in Order of the Phoenix when he shows Harry the photograph of the original order: That’s Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken, they got her whole family. We don't know exactly when the photograph was taken, but we can perhaps infer something from how Moody describes the rest of the dead people in the photograph: That’s Frank and Alice Longbottom —” and that’s Emmeline Vance, you’ve met her, and that there’s Lupin, obviously... Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only ever found bits of him... “That’s Edgar Bones... brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and his family too, he was a great wizard.. Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he looks young... Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we never found his body... Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as ever... Elphias Doge, you’ve met him, I’d forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat... Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes... budge along, budge along...” “That’s Dumbledore’s brother, Aberforth, only time I ever met him, strange bloke... That’s Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her personally... Sirius, when he still had short hair... and... there you go, thought that would interest you!” Harry’s heart turned over. His mother and father were beaming up at him, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man Harry recognized at once as Wormtail: He was the one who had betrayed their whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped bring about their deaths. Notice how Moody only gives a time frame for the McKinnons and for Caradoc Dearborn, two weeks and six months respectively. It would seem Moody was emphasizing the immediacy of those events, which might imply that the other deaths happened significantly later. If that is the case then it would make sense that James and Lily were killed several months after the McKinnons, which would be consistent with Lily's letter to Sirius being dated around the time of Harry's birthday, once again indicating that Dumbledore's statement to Harry was incorrect. On the other hand, there is perhaps an indication that the letter was in fact written shortly before they died. Note the following statement: James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here The fact that James was \"shut up\" might imply that the Fidelius Charm had already been implemented. In Prisoner of Azkaban Cornelius Fudge describes when that was done: \"And then, barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed —\" \"Black betrayed them?\" breathed Madam Rosmerta. If the letter was written after the Fidelius Charm was performed and the charm was performed a week before Voldemort attacked them then the letter would have been written within a week of Halloween. This would support Dumbledore's version of the Invisibility Cloak timeline. However, it is not necessarily clear that \"shut up\" would refer only to the Fidelius Charm. In this question I noted that Fudge in the very same conversation also indicated that Dumbledore advised the Potters to go into hiding immediately upon learning that Voldemort heard part of the prophecy: According to Fudge in chapter 10 of Prisoner of Azkaban: \"Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies. One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once. He advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn't an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm.\" So it seems that as soon as Snape told Dumbledore that Voldemort was planning on going after the Potters, Dumbledore told the Potters to hide. As I discussed in that question, it is hard to understand why they would have hid for so long without the Fidelius Charm, but be that as it may, it is thus possible to understand \"shut up\" from Lily's letter as referring to the longer period of hiding, in which case it would still be consistent with the other information pointing to the letter having been written earlier. Based on the above arguments, I would think it more likely that Dumbledore's claim of \"a few days\" is incorrect. However, that does not necessarily mean that Dumbledore was maliciously or deliberately misleading Harry. He may have simply made a mistake. Granted Dumbledore is supposed to be brilliant, but keep in mind that he is talking about events that occurred 16 years previously. The precise amount of time that he had the cloak for may not have been an important detail in his mind so he may not have remembered it correctly. He may have just been remembering that he borrowed the cloak shortly before they died, and without remembering the exact timeline he just stated that it was for a few days. Indeed, in his letter to Harry in Philosopher's Stone , Dumbledore simply used the vague phrase \"before he died\": Your father left this in my possession before he died. On the other hand, at the end of Philosopher's Stone Dumbledore does lie to Harry about the circumstances of the cloak, when he makes it sound like it was a coincidence that James gave it to him: \"Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\" However, at that time Dumbledore was nowhere near ready to tell Harry the truth about the Hallows, so the bit of misinformation is understandable. By the time he tells Harry everything at the end of Deathly Hallows there wouldn't be much of a reason for him to deliberately lie about how long he had had the cloak for. Of course, as noted in the question, this is very possibly simply an authorial mistake. However brilliant and truthful Dumbledore is supposed to be in the story, he is still at the mercy of the author not tripping him up by forgetting other details.",

        "question_body": "I read something online that got me thinking about this. Why didn't Voldemort suspect Snape had defected from the Death Eaters and was now working for Dumbledore during the events of *Philosopher's Stone? Voldemort was possessing Quirrell's body and his head was protruding from the back of Quirrell's - in other words, Voldemort was with Quirrell constantly during the events of Philosopher's Stone , presumably overhearing whatever Quirrell himself heard. Snape cornered Quirrell more than once (Halloween, when Quirrell let the troll in, and the night Harry broke into the Restricted Section over the Christmas holidays to look for information on Nicholas Flamel) and openly threatened him against working for Voldemort and pressuring him to declare his loyalties to Dumbledore. This obviously revealed Snape's loyalty to Dumbledore to Quirrell, and presumably Voldemort, and I can't think of a reason why Voldemort wouldn't have been able to hear Snape strong-arming Quirrell perfectly clearly. Why didn't Voldemort attempt to make contact with Snape during Philosopher's Stone ? After all, Snape was supposedly Voldemort's most faithful servant. How is it Voldemort didn't suspect Snape was working for Dumbledore and didn't orchestrate a move against him? Snape wasn't even pretending to be a double agent during Philosopher's Stone , so why Voldemort didn't kill Snape as soon as he was physically able, or have Quirrell attempt to kill him, is unclear.

        "answer": "Voldemort's appearance became more snake-like as he delved deeper into Dark Magic, and his face became more serpentine, which would presumably explain the flattening of his nose. Mention of Voldemort's serpentine appearance is mentioned in every book. It's theorized that each murder Voldemort committed, the more distorted his face became. There is a scene where Dumbledore shows Harry a memory of Voldemort after he resurfaced after being gone for ten years. He came to hide the Ravenclaw Horcrux and to ask Dumbledore, who was newly appointed headmaster, for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position, and his appearance is drastically changed (this would be been around circa 1956) from when he had gone to work at Borgin and Burkes ten years prior. It's fair to speculate Voldemort was deeply involved in Dark Magic; Dumbledore notes that he hopes \"half of what he's heard (about Voldemort's Dark Arts activities) isn't true.\" Regarding the movies, super short answer: CGI removed Voldemort's nose. There's a segment in the extra scenes where Voldemort's nose is discussed extensively. Ralph Fiennes was very opposed to the flat nose and had to be convinced of the scary aesthetic value of that choice.",

        "question_body": "Inspired by this question , I'm wondering if there are any instances of characters turning from good to evil in the Harry Potter universe. There are a few people who turn from bad to good (such as Snape, Karkaroff, Regulus Black etc.), but I can't think of any instances of going in the other direction. I'm not looking for a complete turnaround as in the linked question, as I doubt there are many instances of a 180 flip (although bonus points if there are), but preferably an example of someone who entirely went from good to evil without being under the effects of the Imperius curse. For example were there any members of the Order of the Phoenix who defected, or maybe students who were part of Dumbledore's Army who ended up siding with Voldemort (i.e. people who actively worked against Voldemort or other evil forces, and ended up joining them or becoming evil themselves). A good example would be Peter Pettigrew, however even though he was part of the Order it is never really stated in the books that he was ever \"good\", more that he just followed his friends, and ended up betraying them out of fear as opposed to evil. I'm thinking more of a Lupin or Kingsley type character who ended up becoming bad. Sirius would have been a prime example, if the events that everyone believed had transpired at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban had been true (i.e. being an upstanding Order member, then becoming Voldemort's supporter and betraying Harry's parents).",
        "answer": "If we're willing to accept going from good to doing bad things as being partially evil , then there's an obvious answer no one's mentioned: Harry Potter. Harry does a number of morally questionable things in Deathly Hallows . Many of them can be written off as desperate times calling for desperate measures, such as Imperiusing Gringotts staff. However, he also chooses to Cruciatus Amycus Carrow--not because of situational necessity, but in retaliation for his disrespect of Professor McGonagall. There are no exigent circumstances requiring this act. Harry is merely angry and wants to cause pain to someone he considers a justified target. And we know--from Bellatrix Lestrange's words in Order of the Phoenix --that this simply wouldn't work, absent the actual desire to cause pain for its own sake: \"You need to mean them, Potter. You need to really want to cause pain — to enjoy it\" I think it's pretty clear that focused sadism directed at someone you've never even met before counts as an evil step. Sure, Carrow deserves punishment, he's done horrible things; but this little moment of extrajudicial torture is very difficult to justify in any civilized framework. This isn't even Jack Bauer torture, looking for information; it's for the sheer evil joy of getting back at someone.",

        "question": "What is the architecture of the Floo Network?",
        "question_body": "Muggles have 3 models of network architecture: How is the Floo Network built? It has the ability to: disable fireplaces, e.g. Umbridge's Hogwarts lockout add new fireplaces at will, e.g. Borgin and Burkes have an open fireplace during work hours, but require specific fireplaces (the Dursleys' fireplace didn't work). What are the requirements to be attached to the Network? How is it managed and who adds new fireplaces to the network and how? Can one simply join or disconnect at will or do you need to send a schedule to the Ministry or Floo Network Provider?",
        "answer": "Here's an insight into the possible structure of the network: In the Chamber of Secrets, Harry sees glimpses of other fireplaces as he is traveling through the Floo network: It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed to be spinning very fast — the roaring in his ears was deafening — he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick —something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning — now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face — squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond — his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him — he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and then… He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap. The detail of seeing multiple fireplaces before reaching the final destination would imply that the Floo network is not a centralized network model. That leaves us with a decentralized model, a distributed model, or something else (because magic). As Zala pointed out, because of temporary connections and connections that can be easily disconnected, it would make a decentralized model quite an unattractive option. Thus I conclude that the Floo network most closely resembles the distributed model, unless there is a special network model that wizards and witches have knowledge of that Muggles do not. EDIT: R.M. in the comments on the question suggested that a completely connected network would be feasible for wizards and witches. However, again with the evidence that a person traveling the Floo Network catches glimpses of multiple fireplaces, I doubt this is the case. Why stop at different nodes in the network if you can get to another fireplace in a single leap?",

        "question_body": "How could Harry and Ron so easily fly Mr. Weasley's car (the magically enhanced Ford Anglia) to Hogwarts, when many times in the book it is mentioned that Hogwarts is protected by various spells, such that even Dumbledore had to revert all the security spells in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince so that Harry and Dumbledore could enter Hogwarts on a broomstick?",
        "answer": "The evidence points that there were no restrictions or preventative spells keeping people from flying into and out of Hogwarts till year 6. Addition - ‘There are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people entering by stealth. You can’t just Apparate in here.And I’d like to see the disguise that could fool those Dementors. They’re guarding every single entrance to the grounds. They’d have seen him fly in, too. And Filch knows all the secret passages, they’ll have them covered ...’ Here we have Hermione spelling it out fairly clear that the enchantments do NOT prevent people from flying in. In year 1 Charlie Weasley’s friends fly in and out to take out Norbert. The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that....About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much. Year 2 we have the flying car fly into the grounds. Year 3 we have Sirius Black flying out of Hogwarts on Buckbeak. He squeezed Buckbeak’s sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more ... the Hippogriff took off into the air ... he and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harry gazed after them ... then a cloud drifted across the moon ... they were gone. Year 4 the Beauxbatons carriage flew in. Something large, much larger than a broomstick – or indeed, a hundred broomsticks – was hurtling across the deep blue sky towards the castle, growing larger all the time... they saw a gigantic, powder-blue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring towards them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant. Year 5 Harry and crew fly Thestrals out of the grounds, and Fred and George fly out on broom. Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast: the Thestral streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating; the cooling air was slapping Harry’s face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him, each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their Thestral to protect themselves from his slipstream. And Peeves, who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset. Finally, in year 6 we see the protections are added. “Alohomora!” he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock, but nothing happened. “That won’t work on these,” said Tonks. “Dumbledore bewitched them himself.” Harry looked around. “I could climb a wall,” he suggested. “No, you couldn’t,” said Tonks flatly. “Anti-intruder jinxes on all of them. Security’s been tightened a hundredfold this summer.” Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they could enter at speed.",

Before actually giving out the items specified in Dumbledore’s will to the people they were supposed to be given to, the Ministry kept them to inspect them first. The Ministry could only legally keep the items for thirty-one days before having to pass them on if they couldn’t prove the objects were dangerous, so when that time was up, they had to give them on. “Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give us what he left us?’ ‘Isn’t it obvious?’ said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. ‘They wanted to examine whatever he’s left us. You had no right to do that!’ she said, and her voice trembled slightly. ‘I had every right,’ said Scrimgeour dismissively. ‘The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate the contents of a will –” Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 7 (The Will of Albus Dumbledore) The Ministry might not handle all wills, though - they wanted to inspect Dumbledore’s items specifically. Scrimgeour also wanted to question them about the items. When giving out the items, Scrimgeour also questioned Harry, Ron and Hermione about why Dumbledore would leave them these particular items. If he left someone else do it, he couldn’t question the intended recipients like he did. In addition, he thought there might be something hidden in the Snitch, so wanted to see Harry open it.",

It seems likely, therefore, that the spell must be a new one, dating to some time during the series. We know from HBP that Snape was an inventor of spells, he must have figured out a way to do it. Voldemort likely imitated him. It could have been the reverse (Snape learning from Voldemort), but likely one learned from the other. So, that seems ultimately to be the answer. Most likely, the other answers about it not really being required contributed to the fact that the spell hadn't been invented, and thus that no one from the Order really cared to try it out.",

        "question": "Was the casting of Alan Rickman as Snape based on the full knowledge of the future of that character?",
        "question_body": "Casting Alan Rickman (a great actor) in the role of Snape would make a great deal of sense if one considers the depth of the character as exposed by all the books up to the seventh one. A great example is the deleted scene from the HBP movie : The still – which does absolutely no justice to Rickman's talent – is on HP Wikia . I'd prefer not to post the links to the video as that might violate copyright. The scene shows the choir singing 'In Noctem` and then Snape looking out at the approaching darkness. But it seems a mite of an overkill (shades of Alec Guinness here) if one merely needs to portray an somewhat evilly guy from \"The Philosopher's Stone\" – yes, Rickman played those before (e.g. Die Hard), but still an overkill – and he's been known to turn down blockbuster roles before (he turned down the villain role in 007 movie Goldeneye . Is there any support for the theory that the casting of Alan Rickman was done based on at least a rough idea of his full story and depth as a character in JKR's mind? Ideally I'd like an explicit statement from someone involved; but circumstantial evidence based on timelines would also be OK if the former doesn't exist.",
        "answer": "From wikipedia : Severus Snape appears in all eight Harry Potter films, portrayed by British actor Alan Rickman. Rickman was Rowling's personal choice to portray the character. He had conversations with Rowling about his character and is one of the few Harry Potter actors that she spoke to prior to the completion of the book series about the future direction of the character. \"He knew very early on that he'd been in love with Lily,\" said Rowling. \"He needed to understand […] where this bitterness towards this boy who's the living example of her preference for another man came from.\" Also from a Time article: Rowling also had a hand in choosing most of the adult cast members. She specifically requested Coltrane. Others, like Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape came straight from a wish list of actors that Rowling provided the producers. She gave Rickman and Coltrane precious bits of information about their characters' futures. And, from a much later Time article , Alan Rickman is quote as saying: \"Three children have become adults since a phone call with Jo Rowling, containing one small clue, persuaded me that there was more to Snape than an unchanging costume, and that even though only three of the books were out at that time, she held the entire massive but delicate narrative in the surest of hands.\"",

        "question_body": "Most of the wand-carriers that come from a non-Muggle family seem fairly uneducated when it comes to interacting with Muggles. This implies that they don't go to any type of Muggle school before entering into their education at Hogwarts (or whichever Wizarding school they go to), or else they would at least understand some Muggle culture. What do children from magical families do before going to Hogwarts if they don't go to a traditional school? Is there any evidence that they're homeschooled?",
        "answer": "It depends on the family. Some families send their kids to Muggle primary schools. Others home school them. From an interview with JK Rowling: Kai: \"Where do wizarding children go to school before Hogwarts?\" JK Rowling: \"They can either go to a Muggle primary school or they are educated at home. The Weasleys were taught by Mrs. Weasley.\" And so were most of the children from wizarding families. Also, J.K.Rowling's Official Site F.A.Q tells us: What education do the children of wizards have before going to Hogwarts? They are, as many of you have guessed, most often home educated. With very young children, as you glimpsed at the wizards' camp before the Quidditch World Cup in 'Goblet of Fire', there is the constant danger that they will use magic, whether inadvertently or deliberately; they cannot be trusted to keep their true abilities hidden. Even Muggle-borns like Harry [sic] attract a certain amount of unwelcome attention at Muggle schools by re-growing their hair overnight and so on.",

So, I am posting it here out of curiosity. \"Did the Marauder's Map show Mad Eye Moody when he was hidden inside his own trunk?\" The map should show Mad-Eye Moody inside the DADA teacher's office even when Barty Crouch Jr was impersonating Moody elsewhere. One glance at the map would be enough to blow Barty Jr's cover. Was there something about the magical chest that Barty hid him in? One possible answer given in the other post is \"The inside of Moody's trunk might be unplottable,\" The trunk has the Undetectable Extension Charm to make the inside bigger than the outside (much like the Weasley's tent or Hermione's purse), but nothing in the description for that spell says it automatically makes the interior unplottable. Is there anything from the books that hints at why he didn't show up on the map?",
        "answer": "It is unknown whether Mad Eye Moody was visible on the map even when he was hidden in his trunk. Still if he was it is completely plausible that Harry just ignored seeing him since the trunk was in the DADA teacher's room, where Mad Eye was expected to be. In more detail: First of all Harry does not look at the map all the time. He used the map more often during his sixth year but before that he only checked on it when he wanted to have a clear path during the night. Even if Harry took a look at the map and saw Mad Eye Moody, so what? He wasn't on a place where one would not expect to find him. Exactly the opposite - he was in his room. He could have seen BOTH Barty Crouch Jr. and Mad Eye in the room but this is also not something unexpected or too unusual. The map only shows \"Barty Crouch\" and Harry could assume that Barty Crouch Sr. is just visiting Moody for some reason. It would have been suspicious to see Mad Eye in his room under following circumstances: in class when Harry sees fake Mad Eye in front of him during eating times in the Great Hall when fake Mad Eye is there Still this never happens. The DADA lessons are interesting enough to keep Harry from looking at the map and the Great Hall is too crowded and Harry keeps the map a secret so he does not want to show it to everyone.",

I weep for the left-handed witches and wizards who have to use those feather quills and ink pots to write, and it all seems so unnecessary. A Biro is not like a TV or a toaster. It is a simple device utilizing gravity fed ink to coat a ball bearing with a thin coat of ink, allowing for easy writing. I see no reason why it wouldn't work in Hogwarts, so why do they insist on using feather quills?",
        "answer": "I'm reasonably sure everything used in Hogwarts is produced in the magical world, possibly using (you're not going to believe it) magic. As such, I don't think wizards can produce ballpoint pens, because that would require them to follow some advancements in technology, which they famously don't do. Remember Mr. Weasley, and how everyone thinks he's a wacko. My point is - the supplies in magical world (including stationery) must be produced magically due to wizards' alienation from Muggles; I'm not saying a pen wouldn't work, I'm simply saying wizards wouldn't think of using one. Or chalk it up to quill-makers' lobby. As to why Muggle-borns don't use them - what if they do? Since the series is centered very narrowly on the trio, there's not much room for others' perspective. Maybe some Muggle-borns do use them, we just don't see it (observer bias). There's also the problem of anti-Muggle sentiment, which seems to exist even in late 90s when the series is set. I assume showcasing one's Muggle-bornness would not be a very wise choice, especially with Voldemort's growing influence in later books. The issue of wizarding pride is mentioned in the Pottermore article on technology , written by J. K. Rowling: There is another reason for most wizards' avoidance of Muggle devices, and that is cultural. The magical community prides itself on the fact that it does not need the many (admittedly ingenious) devices that Muggles have created to enable them to do what can be so easily done by magic. To fill one's house with tumble dryers and telephones would be seen as an admission of magical inadequacy. I'm guessing a quill and an ink bottle are also easier to use in conjunction with magic - one can enchant the quill to write, regularly dipping itself in ink, and maybe sharpen itself. How does one refill a ballpoint pen? I don't. I throw it away, and get a new one; or if I really like it, I get a new core and change them. But the core of a pen is the part that is actually the hardest to make, what with the small ball, tiny tube, and the ink. The schematics of a quill are just simpler. And why stop on pens? Why not use A4 paper, like normal people do, instead of parchment (and why not measure the parchment in metres, like normal people do, instead of feet)? I'm guessing the scope of possible improvements is too wide, and people just don't care. One could also point out that glasses, watches, and some other tools are used by wizards. I'm guessing that is due to them being invented before the International Statute of Secrecy, which was accepted in 1692. The Hogwarts Express is a notable Muggle invention that is being used by Wizards. However, this one is very much an edge case. As it is explained in its Pottermore article written by J. K. Rowling, the train was the best option possible when it came to transporting a lot of students at one time, while still being hidden from Muggles. Multiple solutions, including various flying transportation methods, portkeys, and sometimes Apparition were tried, and some were meant to be tried but were blocked by the Headmasters of Hogwarts as breaching the security of the castle. In the end, it took a Muggle-curious Minister of Magic, \"one hundred and sixty-seven Memory Charms and the largest ever mass Concealment Charm performed in Britain\" to steal the train and put it to use. It was by no means easy, and definitely met opposition at the time: The Hogwarts Express underwent several magical modifications before the Ministry approved it for school use. Many pure-blood families were outraged at the idea of their children using Muggle transport, which they claimed was unsafe, insanitary and demeaning; however, as the Ministry decreed that students either rode the train or did not attend school, the objections were swiftly silenced. There's also the problem of very few Muggle-borns, who would know about pens, being in charge of things. Sure, some students are Muggle-borns, but how many of the Ministry officials, or even the Hogwarts staff, are also Muggle-born? I would assume a Muggle-born taking over the ministry could change things for the best, but that would require a sequel to the seven Harry Potter books, and we haven't gotten one . There is also a relevant Quora thread , which says more or less the same things, and maybe more.",

        "question": "Why didn't Snape just kill Voldemort to buy more time while the latter was recuperating as a Horcrux?",
        "question_body": "When Snape was in the company of Voldemort, why did he not just use Avada Kedavra on him? Voldemort's body would again be destroyed, and he'd become a soul again, and we know that in this form, Voldemort could easily be dealt with (hence why he hid himself in Albania's forests), when compared to a fully corporeal Voldemort. While he was a soul and trying to get another body, you could spend that time killing the rest of his horcruxes.",
        "answer": "Well you are of course right to suggest in your question that robbing Voldemort of his mortal body isn't a bad plan; he could not be a general, he could not set about acquiring the Elder Wand, he could not lay his plans. But it would not kill him, it would just leave him bodiless once more. But this time, this time his Death Eaters will not believe him gone, this time Wormtail knows what to do to resurrect him. Is it worth risking Snape's life for this minor delaying tactic? Well, clearly Dumbledore and Snape don't think so, and I would agree with them. Snape is the spy, the double agent, the man on the inside, without him, Dumbledore, Harry and the entire Order are much worse off in the long game. That's one part of it. But a second part of it is that it is not actually all that easy to kill a man. It's harder than you imagine. The enormity of the act. Making sure your aim is true, choosing your time, your weapon, making your escape. This is why real life assassinations are very carefully planned and many of them fail. Think of Castro and the veritable legendarium that his built up around the attempts on his life. Could Severus Snape presume to surprise Voldemort alone and just fire off Avada Kedavra and get it over that quickly? Not obviously. Voldemort is not very often in such a vulnerable position. [S]he had no wand upon her either ... how stupid they were, and how trusting, thinking that their safety lay in friends, that weapons could be discarded even for moments ... Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - p.281 - Bloomsbury - Chapter 17, Bathilda's Secret [I]t had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy: didn't their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was, ever, to trust? Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - pp.444-5 - Bloomsbury - Chapter 24, The Final Hiding Place '...You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.' Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - p.260 - Bloomsbury - Chapter 13, The Secret Riddle Once he has his body back, he does not have around him trusted assistants who could sneak up and kill him in his sleep. And what if he should be vulnerable for a second? The creak of a floorboard, Voldemort turns around, the curse just misses, and then what does Snape do? Well, I'll tell you what he does, he dies, that's what he does :P But perhaps you're not convinced, so I'll add one final thing. Tom Riddle can read minds. '[...] The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency -' 'What's that? Sir? ' 'It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another person's mind -' Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - p.468 - Bloomsbury - Chapter 24, Occlumency And Tom Riddle is so accomplished that he can do this without even looking at the person. '[...] And I'll tell you this, too,' he added, on a sudden inspiration, 'my wife knows I'm up here, and if I don't come back -' 'You have no wife,' said the cold voice, very quietly. 'Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows ... he always knows ...' 'Is that right?' said Frank roughly. 'Lord, is it? Well, I don't think much of your manners, my Lord. Turn round and face me like a man, why don't you?' Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - pp.18-9 - Bloomsbury - Chapter 1, The Riddle House Now, it's true, Snape can close his mind. But can he kill his own master, Tom Riddle, without Voldemort noticing? I wouldn't bet my life on it? And recall, Avada Kedavra requires a strong bit of magic behind it. It seems to be perhaps the only curse that cannot be cast non-verbally. You can't just kill someone like that. 'Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nose-bleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it.' Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - p.192 - Bloomsbury - Chapter 14, The Unforgivable Curses 'Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?' she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. 'You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain - to enjoy it - righteous anger won't hurt me for long - I'll show you how it is done, shall I? Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - p.715 - Bloomsbury - Chapter 36, The Only One He Ever Feared And these necessary emotions that you must summon up can be read by a Legilimens. You could try and stun him first, I suppose, or something like that. You could try. But your fear, your nervous excitement. Maybe Snape is the one person who could keep it down, but surely Tom Riddle is the one person who could notice. And it's not as if he spends much time in the company of Severus Snape. And I'm sure he's never wandless, never unable to notice Snape attempting to draw his wand, never with his guard down. Which means that Snape assassinating Voldemort would never be the plan - it's too high risk. Which means that he wouldn't be looking for opportunities. Maybe, in all the years when Voldemort had a body there were times when a man looking for an opportunity to kill Tom Riddle, might have been able to do it, just. But Snape would not have been looking for such an opportunity. He would not have been trying. So he would not have noticed these moments and if he did, by the time he'd thought about it, they would have passed. Voldemort would have faced him once more, would have moved away, would have summoned another Death Eater, or whatever.",

        "question": "Why didn't Voldemort kill Snape with Avada Kedavra?",
        "question_body": "Voldemort was very fluent in Avada Kedavra . He never ever hesitated before using that. Also, there was no thumbs down in using it. Avada Kedavra was quick and effective. Why didn't Voldemort kill Snape with Avada Kedavra ?",
        "answer": "Because he thought Snape was the true master of the Elder Wand, and didn't want this to backfire. \"Why doesn't it work for me, Severus?\" In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled--or was it Voldemort's sibilant sigh lingering on the air? \"My--my lord?\" said Snape blankly. \"I do not understand. You--you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.\" \"No,\" said Voldemort. \"I have performed my usual magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand...no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.\" Voldemort's tone was musing, calm, but Harry's scar had begun to throb and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort. Voldemort believes that because Snape killed Dumbledore, the Elder Wand's allegiance lies with Snape. Although Voldemort is currently using the wand, he notes that it doesn't behave as it should for him. By killing Snape, he hopes that it will change its allegiance to him. However, he doesn't want this to backfire (as we see it does when he tries to kill Harry, the Wand's true owner, with it). It's reasonable to assume that the most powerful wand in history won't want to kill its owner. So, to be on the safe side, he uses another method, the one closest to him and easiest at the time - Nagini. \"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.\" Other possible factors: He's hella mad and wants blood. In Voldemort's mind, Snape is in the way of what he needs. Being so close to killing Potter, only to discover that your servant has very inconsiderately claimed the wand you want, might make you angry. This fury may have made him more inclined to kill Snape, previously considered loyal, in a relatively gruesome way. On the other hand, maybe he's quite attached to Snape, and doesn't want to actually kill him himself. By making Nagini do it, he's offsetting the responsibility. However, this seems unlikely given his temperament - the passage says \"He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse.\" As pointed out by chirlu in the comments, JKR needed a way for Snape to reveal his motives, which he would only do close to death. Edit: If this is the case, why would he try to use Avada Kedavra on Harry, when he knows that Harry is the true master of the wand? I would argue that he does not really believe that Harry is the master of the Elder Wand. To be honest, I'm not sure that Harry believes it himself. Here's the passage in question: “The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.” Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was gone. “But what does it matter?” he said softly. “Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me [...] and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy...” “But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took his wand from him.” Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it. “So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” whispered Harry. “Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.” A red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s wand: “ Avada Kedavra !” “ Expelliarmus !” At this point, Voldemort is in the middle of a battle. He's not thinking as straight as he would be when planning to murder Snape - he came to Hogwarts, thinking Harry was dead, finds out he isn't, thinks he's still superior. His supreme arrogance still remains. Plus, Harry's argument is based on an exceedingly complex bit of wandlore - I doubt there would be a known precedent to base it on, either way. Note that he phrases it as a question - almost a test, daring Voldemort to call his bluff. Voldemort, at this point, is arrogant, angry, filled with adrenaline and confident enough in his stupidly complex plan. Nagini at this point is dead - he can't have her murder him. He also doesn't truly realise the protection Harry has granted himself and others by being willing to die for them, and therefore that Harry effectively has a backup shield. So, he takes the chance.",

        "question": "Why wasn't James Potter his own Secret Keeper?",
        "question_body": "Why wasn't James Potter his own Secret Keeper? The whole thing came about because Potters chose the wrong Secret Keeper (who betrayed them) for the Fidelius Charm on their house. Why didn't James just make himself a Secret Keeper? We know that it’s possible from Deathly Hallows : (Bill and Arthur Weasley are their own Secret Keepers) . “I’ve been getting them all out of the Burrow,” Bill explained. “Moved them to Muriel’s. The Death Eaters know Ron’s with you now, they’re bound to target the family – don’t apologize,” he added at the sight of Harry’s expression. “It was always a matter of time, Dad’s been saying so for months. We’re the biggest blood traitor family there is.” “How are they protected?” asked Harry. “Fidelius Charm. Dad’s Secret-Keeper. And we’ve done it on this cottage too; I’m Secret-Keeper here.\"",
        "answer": "“You think I'm a fool?\" demanded Harry. \"No, I think you're like James,\" said Lupin, \"who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends.” ― J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows I don`t think the book mentions why, but the above quote shows that James trusted his friends implicitly which is why he probably thought the secret was just as safe with his friends as with himself.",

        "question": "Are werewolves in the Forbidden Forest consistent with later explanations on werewolves?",
        "question_body": "In the Philosopher's Stone , Harry, Hermione, Neville and Draco are punished and have to assist Hagrid in his search for a dying unicorn. Malfoy mentions that according to rumors, there are werewolves in the Forbidden Forest. When they ask if a werewolf could kill a unicorn, Hagrid answers that they are not fast enough to do that. He does not answer, \"There are no werewolves in the forest\", which is evidence that there are indeed werewolves (since Hagrid knows the ins and outs of the Forest as we are told). Now from what we learn in The Prisoner of Azkaban , werewolves are humans that were bitten by other werewolves; they transform into werewolves during a full moon. Does the information we get on werewolves in book 3 contradict what we can infer from book 1? In particular: Why would Hagrid not refute the idea of werewolves attacking unicorns simply using the fact that they transform once per month, and that Hagrid found two different unicorns attacked in a week (instead of using a dubious speed argument)? Why would werewolves stay in the Forbidden Forest all year, when we know werewolves are actually human people who, although they are often rejected by normal wizards, would probably not be ignored by Hagrid and especially by Dumbledore, who I can't imagine would not offer any help to infected people staying in the forest near his school. Why would they even let werewolves occupy the forest if one bite on a student could kill him or infect him for life? Sure it's the \"Forbidden\" Forest but, assuming there were werewolves as described in book 3 in it, the werewolves would probably drastically decrease the security of students.",
        "answer": "The \"Werewolves\" in the Forest are Actually Highly Intelligent Regular Wolves This is from the Pottermore entry on werewolves: One curious feature of the condition is that if two werewolves meet and mate at the full moon (a highly unlikely contingency which is known to have occurred only twice) the result of the mating will be wolf cubs which resemble true wolves in everything except their abnormally high intelligence. They are not more aggressive than normal wolves and do not single out humans for attack. Such a litter was once set free, under conditions of extreme secrecy, in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts, with the kind permission of Albus Dumbledore. The cubs grew into beautiful and unusually intelligent wolves and some of them live there still, which has given rise to the stories about ‘werewolves’ in the Forest – stories none of the teachers, or the gamekeeper, has done much to dispel because keeping students out of the Forest is, in their view, highly desirable. So the wolves in the Forbidden Forest are the product of two werewolves mating during the full moon. They are wolves all the time. They aren't particularly dangerous -- certainly not as dangerous as werewolves during the full moon. And even if there is some mild danger associated with them, this isn't inconsistent with the books since lots of things in the Forest could be dangerous -- the gazillion giant spiders that are only kept in check by Hagrid and Aragog, for example.",
